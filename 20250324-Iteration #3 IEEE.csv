The new properties of 5G, such as large bandwidth, high data rates, and extensive coverage, provide promising possibilities for positioning and navigation. In many commercial indoor scenarios, however, only one 5G base station (called gNB) is received by the receiver. This condition constrains the application of traditional geometric positioning methods, which typically rely on observations from multiple gNBs to a certain extent. In this work, we investigate the problem of indoor positioning with a single 5G gNB. We propose to utilize the multibeam property of 5G signals in the synchronization signal block of the downlink, while the fingerprinting method is used based on the multibeam channel state information. Field tests are conducted in different indoor scenarios to verify the effectiveness of the method. The tests show that the method is able to achieve mean absolute errors of positioning within 1.55 m by taking advantage of the multibeam property of 5G signals. Accuracy is improved by more than 54.7% compared with the single beam."",""2475-1472"","""",""10.1109/LSENS.2023.3338252"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10336870"",""Sensor applications";fifth-generation (5G) positioning;channel state information (CSI);multibeam;"sensor networks"",""5G mobile communication";Fingerprint recognition;Amplitude modulation;Support vector machines;Antenna arrays;Structural beams;"Downlink"","""",""6"","""",""22"",""IEEE"",""1 Dec 2023"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The problem is elevated when multiple node failures are repaired to address service quality requirements. Typical approaches include individual or cooperative data regeneration to efficiently utilize the available bandwidth. It is observed that storage systems of 5G and beyond technologies shall have a multi-layer architecture in which base stations (BS) would be present. Moreover, communication with each layer would be subject to various communication costs and link constraints. Under limited BS assistance and cooperation, the trade-off between storage per node and communication bandwidth has been established. In this trade-off, two operating points, namely minimum storage, and bandwidth regeneration are particularly important. In this study, we first identify the optimal number of BS use at the minimum storage regeneration point.

Hence, mathematical models that capture the time-varying staged-construction process, are urgently needed for operators to effectively predict the construction period, but are currently lacking.

Aiming at the diversity and complexity of regional traffic influencing factors of road network in the construction of smart city, this research carries out resource real-time load balancing scheduling from the perspective of 5G heterogeneous network. Meanwhile, CNN (convolutional neural network) in the introduced deep learning algorithm is improved, and finally an intelligent traffic prediction model is constructed based on 5G load balancing and AlexNet network. The model is simulated and its performance is analyzed. The results show that the algorithm proposed is compared with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network), and BN (Bayesian network) models regarding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1. It is found that the road network prediction accuracy of the algorithm proposed is 94.05%, which is at least 4.29% higher than that of the model algorithm proposed by other scholars. The analysis of network data transmission synchronization performance suggests that there are obvious performance improvements in access delay, access collision rate, reliability, and network throughput. Among them, the packet loss rate is lower than 0.1, the access collision rate is basically stable at about 0, the access time is stable at about 75ms, and the sending throughput is basically maintained at about 1, which is significantly better than the performance of other algorithms.

The beamforming of 5G NR can improve the accuracy and the flexibility of connections between the mobile devices.

The currently used construction methods of polar code are generally based on the reliability of each polarized sub-channel, which directly correspond to the Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm. However, much less is known about the optimal construction of polar codes under more sophisticated decoding methods such as the Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding. There is currently no perfect theory to derive the optimal construction for the SCL decoding to the best of our knowledge, because finding such optimal construction of SCL is considered to be a hard problem for normal choices of the list size. To address this problem, in this paper we turn to evolutionary computation, and propose a memetic algorithm by incorporating prior knowledge obtained from both the channel estimation of the SC-profile and the codeword weight evaluation of the RM-profile, shorted as MA-SCRM. The potential constructions of polar codes are expressed as binary sequences which are processed as the individuals of the population in MA-SCRM. Based on the prior knowledge obtained from the SC-profile and the Reed-Muller-profile, we design special initialization and evolutional operators for polar codes construction. An elitism archive is also introduced to maintain promising constructions and accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. For the SCL decoding, MA-SCRM obtains polar-coding constructions that are more excellent than the SC decoder construction in the sense of block error probability. Compared with the SC decoding construction method, MA-SCRM can reduce the block error probability by up to 48.78% for the original block error rate around $10^{-2}$, and more improvement can be observed for lower original block error rate."",""2471-285X"","""",""10.1109/TETCI.2023.3234564"",""National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFF1202104)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001300,61871272,61976143); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2021A1515011679,2021A1515011911); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515010139); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808173617147,20200811181752003,JCYJ20220531102617039); Open Project of BGIShenzhen(grant numbers:BGIRSZ20200002);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10031603"",""Construction";evolutionary computation;memetic algorithm;polar codes;"SCL decoding"",""Decoding";Polar codes;Codes;Reliability;Channel coding;Memetics;"Maximum likelihood decoding"","""","""","""",""54"",""IEEE"",""30 Jan 2023"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper first maps a polar code to a unique heterogeneous graph called the polar-code-construction message-passing (PCCMP) graph. Next, a heterogeneous graph-neural-network-based iterative message-passing (IMP) algorithm is proposed which aims to find a PCCMP graph that corresponds to the polar code with minimum frame error rate under CA-SCL decoding. This new IMP algorithm’s major advantage lies in its scalability power. That is, the model complexity is independent of the blocklength and code rate, and a trained IMP model over a short polar code can be readily applied to a long polar code’s construction. Numerical experiments show that IMP-based polar-code constructions outperform classical constructions under CA-SCL decoding. In addition, when an IMP model trained on a length-128 polar code directly applies to the construction of polar codes with different code rates and blocklengths, simulations show that these polar-code constructions deliver comparable performance to the 5G polar codes."",""1558-0857"","""",""10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3305523"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10218333"",""Graph neural networks";polar code design;reinforcement learning;"successive-cancellation list decoding"",""Polar codes";Codes;Iterative decoding;Maximum likelihood decoding;Complexity theory;Training;"Reliability"","""",""6"","""",""48"",""IEEE"",""15 Aug 2023"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, the rate-compatible RL-QC-LDPC coded interleave division multiple access (IDMA), or called the enhanced IDMA, is developed as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based random access solution, and various spectral efficiencies can be flexibly supported thanks to the rate compatible capability. First, 5G-NR LDPC codes are directly incorporated into enhanced IDMA-based random access, which can support a wide range of user loads with relatively low system throughput. Second, to improve the supported user load and system throughput, an edge-classification-based extension (ECE) algorithm is proposed to construct rate-compatible RL-QC-LDPC codes toward enhanced IDMA while taking into consideration the novel structural features of 5G-NR LDPC codes. Based on the two proposed edge-classification methods, the ECE can efficiently reduce the search space of base matrices for each extension round and effectively maintain enough diversity in the selected seed base matrices to facilitate further extension. Multi-edge type density evolution-aided extrinsic information transfer chart is employed to predict the asymptotic performance during the base matrix extension and optimization. As an example, a rate-compatible RL-QC-LDPC code family with fine code-rate granularity is constructed via the proposed ECE.

A  $4\times 4$  patch array for FR2 is embedded inside a FR1 shaped patch antenna. The antenna system is designed by preserving a low-profile architecture suitable for planar technology. The performance of the antenna system are evaluated for both the bands achieving a 10-dB bandwidth equal to 0.14 GHz (3.8 %) for FR1 and to 2.32 GHz (8.6 %) for FR2.

Indeed, in addition to the usual data and multimedia traffic, the Internet of Things (IoT) smart applications are creating new traffic types and relationships involving billions of active nodes like sensors and actuators. This traffic raises a problem of scale, particularly for resource management and decision-making mechanisms. The present work addresses for the first time the joint problem of mapping heterogeneous flows from multiple users and applications to transport blocks, and then packing these blocks into the rectangular grid of time–frequency resources within a flexible 5G new radio frame. Our solution is based on a quality-of-service-based classification of flows followed by an offline construction of two databases. The first one enumerates all possible configurations of transport blocks and the second enumerates all possible configurations of frames. Thus, the sole online processing that remains to be done is to find the optimal block configurations that satisfy a given request vector. Hence, the resolution of this complex joint mapping and packing problem is reduced to a simple resolution of a linear problem, which consists in finding the best configurations. A thorough numerical study shows that our configuration-based solution can map, within few tens of milliseconds, more than 100 flow connections to transport blocks incurring only 3% of overallocation, and then pack these blocks into the grid leading to an upper bound on the optimality gap as low as 2.8%."",""2327-4662"","""",""10.1109/JIOT.2021.3074111"","""",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408609"",""2-D packing problem";5G new radio (NR);enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB);Internet of Things (IoT);resource management;"ultrareliable low-latency communications (URLLC)"",""Quality of service";Ultra reliable low latency communication;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;Optimization;"Databases"","""",""3"","""",""44"",""IEEE"",""20 Apr 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we first propose a search scheme that effectively reduces the SK design space based on three aspects: composition, performance, and efficiency. Meanwhile, we completely eliminate the model training from our search scheme. Instead, an easily measurable quantity, the information field, is identified and used to predict the model accuracy in the searching process.

Second, based on the analysis we propose a model transformation scheme to better utilize the SK designs on existing models to either reduce the number of parameters or increase the accuracy.

A PXN enables statistical multiplexing of different data flows, such as fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul flows, and their routing over a commonly shared packet transport network, thus increasing network flexibility and decreasing bandwidth requirements. The decisions concerning the placement of virtualized DU and CU entities at selected processing nodes and the selection of paths for routing of data flows between these nodes have a direct impact on flow latencies. In addition, buffering of packets in switches introduces dynamic, flow-dependent latencies, which as well have to be accounted for in latency-sensitive 5G RANs. In this work, we address a network planning problem that concerns the joint latency-aware placement of DUs/CUs and routing of data flows (LADCPR) for a set of RUs in a 5G RAN connected using a PXN. We model the LADCPR problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem and propose two reformulations of the model that facilitate its solving. Since the MILPs have limited scalability, we develop two heuristic algorithms, based on problem decomposition and an iterative search approach. Numerical experiments performed in different network scenarios show that the algorithms are capable of generating good-quality solutions to the LADCPR problem. Also, they can optimize larger network instances – consisting of tens of switches, a number of routing paths, and comprising some hundreds of demands – within relatively low algorithm run times."",""1932-4537"","""",""10.1109/TNSM.2023.3291668"",""National Science Centre, Poland(grant numbers:2018/31/B/ST7/03456)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10171182"",""5G";Xhaul;packet-switched fronthaul;resource allocation;routing;network optimization;mixed-integer linear programming;"heuristics"",""Routing";Optimization;5G mobile communication;Resource management;Bandwidth;Minimization;"Heuristic algorithms"","""",""3"","""",""46"",""IEEE"",""3 Jul 2023"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Along with efficient communication, the security of messages is one of the concerns that must be maintained throughout the operations. Backhaul forms an essential part of 5GB with an ability to enhance the coverage and quality of service for IoT. However, conventional wired backhaul connection would cost operators thousands of dollars in the construction of 5GB infrastructure considering the ultradense nature of IoT. As a result, wireless backhaul is quickly becoming a feasible alternative to address 5GB’s direction toward network densification without affecting its other provisions. Wireless backhaul is expected to increase the landscape, covering from islands to mountains, which were difficult to access in the existing network generation. Moreover, it can effectively respond to the situation where the data traffic tremendously increased. Despite such provisioning, the wireless backhaul poses relatively various security threats and vulnerabilities due to the characteristics of wireless technologies. Several studies have been conducted to address the security problems";" however, existing protocols do not support dynamic security policy and key management in a decentralized structure as well as secure handover in a specific scenario where Terminals (TMs) are moving. Motivated by this, we proposed the Mobile Terminal Handover (MoTH) security protocol to provide secure handover of mobile terminals between hubs. To solve the problem of existing protocols, a new entity called BMF is introduced to support distributed and dynamic security policy and key management in each serving network of the 5GB backhaul environment. The proposed protocol satisfies security requirements, including authentication and key management, confidentiality, integrity, and perfect forward secrecy. Additionally, it supports policy and key update services, and optimized handover. The security and correctness of the proposed protocol are thoroughly verified using the two formal security analysis tools: 1) BAN logic and 2) Scyther.

The first scheme proceeds with DE separately for ReRAM channels with no sneak path and full sneak path. It then combines these two cases using a weighted approach. The second scheme involves symmetrizing the ReRAM channel based on adding the ternary output, followed by DE to construct polar codes for ReRAM channels. The simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed DE construction methods outperform the polarized weight construction and the 5G construction, approaching the performance of the MC construction."",""1558-2558"","""",""10.1109/LCOMM.2024.3413754"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201283,62201258)"; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2 T2EP50221-0036, SUTD Kickstarter Initiative (SKI)(grant numbers:2021_02_17,2021_04_05); open research fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University(grant numbers:2023D12); “the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities”(grant numbers:30923011035);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10556737"",""ReRAM";sneak path;polar codes;"density evolution"",""Polar codes";Interference;Resistance;Correlation;Genetic algorithms;Error probability;"Maintenance"","""","""","""",""20"",""IEEE"",""13 Jun 2024"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The CCAA is composed of five Chebyshev flexible linear array antennas (LAAs) with a circumferentially uniform arrangement on the cylindrical surface. The LAA with a logarithmic periodic arrangement is constructed by synthesizing the current amplitude distribution coefficients in elements with the Chebyshev method. The LAA with a half-power bandwidth (HPBW) wider than 76° (-8.41° to 38.58°) and a peak gain greater than 10 dBi is fabricated via the micro-electromechanical system process. Cost-performance analysis shows that five is the best number of linear arrays. To achieve omnidirectional switching scanning of the circumferential section, five LAAs wrapped on the cylindrical surface are individually excited by connecting a radio frequency semiconductor switch to the exciting ports of an eight-way power divider. Moreover, beam-switch scanning of the CCAA is measured with the aid of a standard anechoic chamber. The irradiated performance with low mutual coupling and high realized gain is verified to be irrelevant to the structural variation of various flexible experiments of LAAs wrapped around a cylindrical surface. The CCAA with beam-switch scanning operates at 26 GHz and belongs to the 5G millimeter-wave band. Results show the proposed antenna achieves omnidirectional scanning property in the H plane and has a HPBW of only 9.08° in the E plane.

When multi-scenario services coexist in the 5G networks, exploring optimized resource scheduling and allocation strategies become a critical issue. The 5G New Radio (NR) and numerology technologies have been standardized, which lay the foundation for flexible frame structure and adaptive scheduling. In this paper, we propose the self-adaptive flexible transmission time interval (TTI) scheduling (SAFE-TS) strategy in the eMBB and uRLLC coexistence scenario. Machine learning (ML) is applied to achieve flexible TTI scheduling. Moreover, we design the random forest-based ensemble TTI decision algorithm (RF-ETDA) to accomplish the TTI selection for each service. Compared with the existing ML methods, the proposed algorithm has a performance improvement in selecting TTI, especially for the uRLLC services. Then, the TTI selection results will be the basis of system resource scheduling and allocation. The simulation results prove that the proposed SAFE-TS effectively reduce the delay and packet loss rate of the uRLLC services while guaranteeing the eMBB requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that flexible TTI scheduling should be applied in the construction of the 5G networks to achieve superior network performances."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2917751"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871045)"; 111 Project of China(grant numbers:B16006); Nokia;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718287"",""Flexible TTI scheduling";machine learning;delay;control overhead;eMBB;"uRLLC"",""5G mobile communication";Delays;Resource management;Job shop scheduling;OFDM;Frequency-domain analysis;"Machine learning"","""",""57"","""",""26"",""OAPA"",""20 May 2019"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To overcome this issue, two enlarged constant-amplitude sequence constructions that include ZC sequences, and thus being backward-compatible with the current 5G PRACH design, are presented. Both constructions feature a desirable subset structure from which follows a natural cellular network sequence allocation where each cell-specific sequence subset has a controllable low-correlation zone similar to ZC sequences, and thus enables a similar detection performance inside a cell. The two extensions are meanwhile structurally different and offer different network allocations, as for one, new sequences are distributed among all cells, while for the other, they are in separated cells. With both proposed supersets and the new 5G PRACH formats, hundred-times more cells without sequence reuse can be supported compared to ZC sequences for a moderately larger inter-cell correlation than intra-cell correlation.

However, the direction of arrival is susceptible to complex indoor environment. To improve the accuracy and stability of DOA estimation, an adjacent angle power difference (AAPD) method is proposed based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). This method uses OMP to obtain an initial estimate of the direction, and then, adjusts the estimation by calculating the difference power of adjacent points at initial value point to get the fractional DOA. In the scenario of continuous movement, beamforming is further applied, which reduces the amount of calculation. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy and eliminate the error jitter.

We aim to maximize the total sum rate of the RA system by jointly optimizing user pairing and power allocation. The above joint optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer problem, which is challenging to solve. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems. Firstly, a problem for optimal user pairing is formulated to find the optimal user pairing relationship. To solve this subproblem efficiently, a Q-learning based distributed user pairing algorithm (QL-DUPA) is proposed, which converts the user pairing problem to a Q-learning process. The Q-learning process can achieve a near-optimal solution and is practically feasible. Then, a problem for optimal power allocation is formulated to find the optimal power allocation coefficients in each user pair.

Practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder implementations use message-passing decoding with finite precision, which becomes coarse as complexity is more severely constrained. In turn, performance degrades as the precision becomes more coarse. Recently, the information bottleneck (IB) method was used to design mutual-information-maximizing mappings that replace conventional finite-precision node computations. As a result, the exchanged messages in the IB approach can be represented with a very small number of bits. 5G LDPC codes have the so-called protograph-based raptor-like (PBRL) structure which offers inherent rate-compatibility and excellent performance. This paper extends the IB principle to the flexible class of PBRL LDPC codes as standardized in 5G. The extensions include IB decoder design for puncturing and rate-compatibility. In contrast to existing IB decoder design techniques, the proposed decoder can be used for a large range of code rates with a static set of optimized mappings. The proposed construction approach is evaluated for a typical range of code rates and bit resolutions ranging from 3 bit to 5 bit. Frame error rate simulations show that the proposed scheme always outperforms min-sum decoding algorithms and operates close to double-precision sum-product belief propagation decoding. Furthermore, alternatives to the lookup table implementations of the mutual-information-maximizing mappings are investigated."",""2644-125X"","""",""10.1109/OJCOMS.2020.2994048"",""Open Access Funds of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) in the funding programme Open Access Publishing"; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1911166); Physical Optics Corporation; SA Photonics;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091572"",""LDPC codes";5G;message-passing decoding;mutual-information based signal processing;information bottleneck method;"machine learning"",""Decoding";Parity check codes;Quantization (signal);Random variables;5G mobile communication;"Belief propagation"","""",""27"","""",""29"",""CCBY"",""13 May 2020"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recent advancements toward 5G networks add to the complexity where billions of devices, both static and mobile, are connected generating trillions of megabits of data flooding the network and where service providers scuffle daily to deliver key performance indicators: Lower latency, longer battery life, higher data rates, ultra-high reliability, and more connected devices. The optical-fiber world simultaneously witnesses a denser, fiber-rich network infrastructure which is critically challenged in fast economically developing countries by heavy construction of roads and other infrastructures that inflict repeated and unpredictable cuts to the extent that traffic is simultaneously interrupted in up to 10% of the optical links. Thus, network resiliency to fiber failures is already and will continue to be a top priority for operators. Depending on the SLA, operators choose from various resiliency options, e.g., at single network layers or across multiple ones, with dedicated protection or shared restoration, depending on decisive factors like network availability and total cost of ownership (TCO). With traditional network architectures, high resiliency comes with significantly increased TCO involving optical transport network (OTN) switches, L1 protection switching, and L1 restoration. This translates into high CAPEX and excessive space and power consumption, hampering the desirable seamless scalability with the continuously increasing demand for more capacity. This paper explores an alternative hyperscale network architecture, which is adaptable and resilient to multiple fiber failures, thus delivering committed service levels to the end users and which, at the same time, significantly reduces network cost compared to a traditional all OTN-switched network. The hyperscale architecture exploits low footprint carrier grade, data center interconnect type high-density transponders and cost-effective optical protection switching and restoration via software defined networking control. The paper also describes a routing and grooming algorithm to dimension a shared resource pool for optical restoration and a statistical simulation method for time effective execution, simulating failures over a carefully selected sub-set of failure scenarios to guarantee a high degree of network availability. Via network simulation, the paper demonstrates that multiple failure resiliency and cost effectiveness do not necessarily represent a contradiction in transport networks as long as an appropriate network architecture is chosen and that efficient network planning and optimization are applied."",""1558-2213"","""",""10.1109/JLT.2019.2920305"",""H2020 METRO-HAUL project(grant numbers:761727)"; FCT/MEC; FEDER—PT2020(grant numbers:UID/EEA/50008/2019);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8727501"",""Networks";network optimization;network survivability;"protection and restoration"",""Optical fiber networks";Optical switches;Optical fibers;Network architecture;5G mobile communication;"Resilience"","""",""14"","""",""34"",""IEEE"",""31 May 2019"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is an essential technique to enable these features, using antenna arrays with a sufficient number of elements to generate accurate and high-gain beams to desired user locations. In newer services, various forms of mobile devices are expected to appear in diverse locations, and beamforming need to accommodate such directional diversification. However, utilization of existing array structures has a limitation in transmitting signals to arbitrary receiver positions in the three-dimensional space. Therefore, a new type of array capable of forming accurate beams in isotropic fashion is desired, and the corresponding transmission strategies need to be identified. In this paper, the construction and utilization of the three-dimensional uniform spherical array (USA) are investigated.

The code construction involves the design of base matrices and exponent matrices for the designed codes. A progressive row elimination and addition algorithm is proposed for designing the code base matrices from a high rate to low rates. This algorithm leads to the nested and systematic structure of the parity-check matrices, which are desirable for practical implementations of their encoders and decoders, while ensuring the optimal decoding thresholds. In addition, we construct a circulation coefficient matrix based on finite fields and select the optimal rows in this matrix to construct exponent matrices while considering of cycle structures.

Multi-kernel polar codes have been proposed as a method that allows the construction of polar codes with sizes different from powers of 2 by mixing multiple kernels of different dimensions. A hardware implementation based on the successive cancellation (SC) algorithm found in the literature shows that it suffers from a long decoding latency.

Therefore, this article mainly aims to study and understand the principle of voice cloning attack technology, putting forward a voice clone attack method, in order to prepare for the construction of a specific voice recognition system in the future. At present, the key technology of voice cloning attack is how to solve the problem that the target speaker's personalized speech with high quality cannot be synthesized under small samples. In fact, voice cloning is a very challenging problem because speech is more difficult to be represented in the hidden space of the model. We propose a transductive voice transfer learning method to learn the predictive function from the source domain and fine-tune in the target domain adaptively. The target learning task and the source learning task are both synthesizing speech signals from the given audio, while the datasets of both domains are different. By adding different penalty values to each instances and minimizing the expected risk, an optimal precise model can be learned. In addition, an evaluation method to verify the audio similarity of the target speaker was given to show the similarity between the synthesized audio and the original audio.

Therefore, a standalone-IRS, which is completely independent of the core network and BSs, is expected to maximize the performance of the IRS.

Allocations in the lower and upper mid-band aim to balance coverage and capacity, but there is limited knowledge about the radio propagation characteristics in the 4–24 GHz frequency bands. Here we present the world’s first comprehensive indoor propagation measurement and channel modeling study at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz in mid-band spectrum conducted at the NYU WIRELESS Research Center spanning distances from 11–97 m using 31 dBm EIRP transmit power with 15 and 20 dBi gain rotatable horn antennas at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, respectively. Analysis of the omnidirectional and directional propagation path loss using the close-in free space model with 1 m reference distance reveals a familiar waveguiding effect in indoor environments for line-of-sight (LOS). Compared to mmWave frequencies, the omnidirectional LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) path loss exponents (PLE) are similar, when using a close-in 1 m free space path loss reference distance model. Observations of the omnidirectional and directional RMS delay spread (DS) at FR1(C) and FR3 as compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies indicate decreasing RMS DS as the carrier frequency is increased. The RMS angular spreads (AS) at 6.75 GHz are found to be wider compared to 16.95 GHz, showing greater number of multipath components from a broader set of directions in the azimuthal spatial plane when compared to higher frequencies.

In contrast, coded caching schemes designed using placement delivery arrays (PDAs) can have linear subpacketization with a penalty in rate.

For the decoding of polar codes, the multi-bit successive cancellation list (MSCL) decoding technique was recently introduced to decrease the decoding latency by decoding several short inner codes in parallel, which preserves high reliability compared to the conventional successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. However, as parallelism increases, the complexity of the decoding path sorting also increases significantly, which makes it resource-intensive for hardware implementation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a configurable critical-set-based multi-bit successive cancellation list (CS-MSCL) decoding algorithm, which first introduces critical sets to the MSCL decoding for the optimization of path pruning. Subsequently, an enhanced CS-MSCL algorithm is introduced for large list-size MSCL decoding, which can boost the error correction performance. Then, an area-efficient decoding architecture is introduced, which supports the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and the CS-MSCL decoding compatible with the 5G standard. The proposed decoder is implemented in SMIC 40 nm CMOS technology with a parallelism degree of 8, which has a peak area efficiency of  $4.64~\mathrm {Gbps/mm^{2}}$  for list size 4 and  $2.01~\mathrm {Gbps/mm^{2}}$  for list size 8.

These works extend the classical Shannon theory and incorporate circuit energy and signal transmit energy to optimize total energy/power consumption of today's communication systems. Then, we survey recent work on designing adaptive ECCs to operate energy efficiently even in the presence of extremely large heterogeneity in requirements and conditions. Two constructions of energy-adaptive codes are summarized: energy-adaptive low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and energy-adaptive polar codes. These constructions have shown theoretically and empirically that having adaptivity in code design can save substantial energy, especially when the network has very diverse communication scenarios.

For significant reduction of the decoding complexity, we advocate the key idea of projecting the multi-dimensional constellation elements to a few overlapped complex numbers in each dimension, called low projection (LP). An emerging modulation scheme, called golden angle modulation (GAM), is considered for multi-stage LP optimization, where the resultant multi-dimensional constellation is called LP-GAM. Our analysis and simulation results show the superiority of the proposed LP codebooks (LPCBs) including one-shot decoding convergence and excellent error rate performance.

Multiple UAV-enabled aerial computing (MUEAC) has broken through the limitation of SUEAC and has attracted wide attention. Cooperation among multiple UAVs in MUEAC can fully utilize UAV resources and achieve load balancing. Furthermore, for divisible tasks with data-dependent characteristics, using partial offloading makes task scheduling more flexible compared to binary offloading, thus reducing task processing delay. Therefore, we propose a software defined networking enhanced cooperative MUEAC system. To minimize the processing delay of divisible tasks, we study the problem of joint task scheduling and computing resource allocation under task data dependency and UAV energy consumption constraints. To solve the non-convex problem, a multi-UAV cooperative communication and computing optimization (MCCCO) scheme is proposed.

In the context of machine-type communications, GSTSM enables grant-free medium access without transmitting additional headers to convey each machine's signature information. Hence, it is shown that even at an extreme case where the data packets of two users are always colliding, GSTSM offers throughput gains of up to 33% compared to the best examined header-based scheme. For the same scenario, it is shown that GSTSM based on joint multi-user detection provides throughput gains of up to 2.5× compared with the case where users' signals are detected independently.

Because of the characteristics of mmWave, it is suitable for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service in subway tunnel scenarios, in which there are increasing data rate requirement of passengers to be satisfied. To this end, we propose a new scheme of Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) plus small stations in the carriage, in which the backhaul link is 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) networking with 4G for master node and 5G mmWave for secondary node, so as to overcome the handover burden and penetration loss of mmWave, that is more severe in the high-frequency range. Based on the existing old 4G equipment, mmWave is applied for 5G user-plane connection in NSA dual connection, while the control plane connection still relies on 4G commercial frequency band, in order that even if the millimeter-wave link quality is seriously degraded, the IAB-node can still maintain the connection with the master node and re-establish the mmWave link through the exchange of control information on the 4G low-frequency band. Unlike previous attempts, the proposed approach applies dual link to the backhaul link and 5G commercial frequency band to the in-vehicle access link of small station with Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing technology, so that the bandwidth shared by the operators can be aggregated in one small station and fully used for user access to match the mmWave large bandwidth of the backhaul link. Field trials showed that although the data rates were somewhat unstable at the handover points, which still need to be improved in the future work, the average end-to-end uplink and downlink data rates were greatly improved, compared to the previous average data rates when only outdoor signal penetrating indoors was used in subway tunnel.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel compressed sensing (CS)-based nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme, called the CS-NOMA MIMO scheme, for the downlink of massive mission-critical machine-type communication (mmcMTC). By taking advantage of tensor CS techniques, a novel tensor CS-based packet (frame) structure, called TCS packet (frame), is proposed for the CS-NOMA MIMO scheme to further reduce the transmit time intervals (TTIs), resulting in smaller latency than that using the conventional packet (frame) structure. In the TCS packet (frame) structure, the CS signatures are assigned not only to different users but also to different time slots and different symbols of a time slot, thus achieving a user, time slot, and symbol overload system. We present a sufficient condition for the construction of the CS signatures that ensure effective deployment of tensor CS-based multiuser detection (CS-MUD) in user receivers. Furthermore, we consider the case of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and present an upper bound for the performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve high user overload (up to 5) and time slot overload (up to 3) when the activity ratio of users is 1%. When the time slot overload is 3, the proposed scheme with the TCS packet (frame) shortens time slots by at least 2/3 times that of the typical grant-based NOMA schemes. In addition, the block error rate (BLER) of the proposed scheme with the TCS packet (frame) is much lower than that with the conventional packet (frame), even less than 10-9 by repeat transmission when the time slot overload is 3."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929190"",""National Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2018ZX03001019-003)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61629101,61871041,61671086); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:KZ201911232046); 111 Project(grant numbers:B17007);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765303"",""Nonorthogonal multiple access";tensor compressed sensing;massive mission-critical machine type communication;"multiple input multiple output"",""NOMA";MIMO communication;Reliability;Downlink;5G mobile communication;"Multiuser detection"","""",""4"","""",""42"",""CCBY"",""17 Jul 2019"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although the dataset is decentralized among training devices in federated learning, the model parameters are usually stored in a centralized manner.

To improve training efficiency, we investigate the decentralized federated learning scheme. The decentralized scheme has become feasible with the rapid development of device-to-device communication techniques under 5G. Nevertheless, the convergence rate of learning models in the decentralized scheme depends on the network topology design. We propose optimizing the topology design to improve training efficiency for decentralized federated learning, which is a non-trivial problem, especially when considering data heterogeneity. In this paper, we first demonstrate the advantage of hypercube topology and present a hypercube graph construction method to reduce data heterogeneity by carefully selecting neighbors of each training device—a process that resembles classic graph embedding. In addition, we propose a heuristic method for generating torus graphs. Moreover, we have explored the communication patterns in hypercube topology and propose a sequential synchronization scheme to reduce communication cost during training. A batch synchronization scheme is presented to fine-tune the communication pattern for hypercube topology.

Subsequently, it is analyzed and optimized theoretically, especially with the puncture mechanism, by a modified extrinsic information transfer chart and an asymptotic weight distribution. The generated graph is then extended to a base matrix by a copy-and-permute procedure, accompanied with the matrix split, which is optimized by a progressive edge growth for good randomness and girth property.

In this paper, we focus our main attentions on (n, {3, 4, 5}, Λa, 1, Q)-OOCs with Λa ∈ {(2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 2)}. Tight upper bounds on the maximum code size of (n, {3, 4, 5}, Λa, 1, Q)-OOCs are obtained, and infinite classes of optimal (n, {3, 4, 5}, Λa, 1, Q)-OOCs are constructed."",""1557-9654"","""",""10.1109/TIT.2017.2739778"",""Guangxi Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014GXNSFDA118001)"; NSFC(grant numbers:11671103); Guangxi Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014GXNSFDA118001); Program on the High Level Innovation Team and Outstanding Scholars in Universities of Guangxi Province; Foundation of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Multi-Source Information Mining and Security(grant numbers:15-B-01); Guangxi Ba Gui Team for Research and Innovation;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010460"",""Optical orthogonal code";variable-weight;skew starter;"quadratic residue"",""5G mobile communication";Zinc;Adaptive optics;Quality of service;Upper bound;Multiaccess communication;"Optical fiber networks"","""",""1"","""",""25"",""IEEE"",""14 Aug 2017"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Guided by the slowness dispersion analysis, commercially available AT-Quartz was identified as the optimal substrate that inherently suppresses these unwanted modes without additional countermeasures. The mechanism of slowness manipulation by combining several substrates including AT-Quartz, Si, SiC, and Sapphire with LiTaO3 was studied through the finite-element method (FEM), validating the superior potential of AT-Quartz for transverse mode suppression.

The CDS-based pilot patterns can effectively enhance the performance of sparse channel estimation by applying compressed sensing (CS) techniques. However, the existing CDS pilot patterns are limited to single-input-single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) systems. In MIMO-OFDM systems, as the required number of CDS increases, there will be a growing number of intersecting (overlapping) elements among different CDSs (antennas), thus introducing significant interference among different antennas. To tackle this problem, a special CDS property called identical multi-set intersection (IMI) property is disclosed which can significantly reduce the inter-antenna interference. In addition, two constructions of desired CDS collection $\bf D_{I}$ having such IMI property are presented. To further eliminate the residual interference due to the remaining intersecting elements, i.e. the exact $\lambda$ overlapping positions among all antennas, two pilot placement algorithms, i.e., zero setting (ZS) and partial orthogonal cover coding (POCC), are proposed to achieve orthogonal pilot patterns in frequency. Our simulation results show that our proposed MIMO non-uniform IMI CDS pilot patterns exhibit superior estimation accuracy, closely approaching that of SISO systems. Furthermore, our MSE simulation results also show that, under the same condition, the proposed IMI CDS pilot scheme significantly outperforms the 3GPP 5G NR MIMO-OFDM pilot schemes, offering better estimation performance while maintaining much lower generating complexity compared with other existing multi-antenna pilot schemes."",""1939-9359"","""",""10.1109/TVT.2024.3481014"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62020106001,U23A20274)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171389); Sichuan Provincial Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2023NSFSC1912);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10717333"",""Channel estimation";compressed sensing (CS);multiple-input–multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM);pilot design;cyclic difference set (CDS);"identical multi-set intersection (IMI)"",""OFDM";Channel estimation;Frequency division multiplexing;Matching pursuit algorithms;Symbols;Interference;Compressed sensing;5G mobile communication;Optimization;"Estimation"","""","""","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""15 Oct 2024"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Exploiting physical-layer features to counter spoofing attacks is a promising solution. Although various physical-layer spoofing attack detection (PL-SAD) techniques have been proposed for conventional 802.11 networks in the sub-6GHz band, the study of PL-SAD for 802.11ad networks in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) 60GHz band is largely open. In this paper, to achieve efficient PL-SAD in 5G networks, we propose a unique physical layer feature in IEEE 802.11ad networks, i.e., the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) trace obtained at the receiver in the sector level sweep (SLS) process. The SNR trace is readily extractable from the off-the-shelf device, and it is dependent on both transmitter location and intrinsic hardware impairment. Therefore, it can be used to achieve an efficient detection no matter the attacker is co-located with the legitimate transmitter or not. To achieve spoofing attack detection, we provide two methods based on different machine learning models. For the first method, the detection problem is formulated as a machine learning classification problem. To tackle the small sample learning and fast model construction challenges, we propose a novel neural network framework consisting of a backpropation network, a forward propagation network, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Another method involves a Siamese network, in which the similarity between sample pairs from one device is used to achieve PL-SAD. It can tackle the training problem that the historical data cannot support the identification of the same device in a new communication session. We conduct experiments using off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices, Talon AD7200s and MG360, to evaluate the performance of the proposed PL-SAD schemes. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PL-SAD schemes, and the detection accuracy can reach 99% using small sample sizes under different scenarios."",""1558-2248"","""",""10.1109/TWC.2021.3049160"",""Science and Technology Research Project of Hebei, China(grant numbers:QN2019059)"; Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) and its Northern Virginia (NOVA) Node, an investment in the advancement of cyber research and development, innovation, and workforce development;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321212"",""Spoofing attack detection";5G communications;neural networks;"MmWave MIMO communication"",""Signal to noise ratio";Feature extraction;Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Training;Physical layer;"Azimuth"","""",""9"","""",""31"",""IEEE"",""12 Jan 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The use of millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies guarantees a huge amount of bandwidth ($>$1 GHz) and a high data rate ($>$10 Gbit/s), which are required for CAVs applications. However, high frequency is impaired by severe path loss, and line of sight (LoS) propagation can be easily blocked by static and dynamic obstacles. Several solutions are being investigated, and the most promising one exploits relays. However, traditional relay schemes react to link failure and leverage instantaneous information, which impedes efficient relay selection in highly mobile and complex networks, such as vehicular scenarios.

One of the leading candidates in this regard is represented by successive-cancelation list (SCL) decoding. However, its hardware implementation requires a large amount of memory. Recently, a partitioned SCL (PSCL) decoder has been proposed to significantly reduce the memory consumption. In this paper, we consider the paradigm of PSCL decoding from a practical standpoint, and we provide several improvements. First, by changing the target signal-to-noise ratio and consequently modifying the construction of the code, we are able to improve the performance at no additional computational, latency, or memory cost. Second, we bridge the performance gap between SCL and PSCL decoding by introducing a generalized PSCL decoder and a layered PSCL decoder. In this way, we obtain almost the same performance of the SCL decoder with a significantly lower memory requirement, as testified by hardware implementation results. Third, we present an optimal scheme to allocate cyclic redundancy checks.

An established computational problem on hybridization networks is constructing the most parsimonious hybridization network such that each of the given phylogenetic trees (called gene trees) is “displayed” in the network. There have been several previous approaches, including an exact method and several heuristics, for this NP-hard problem. However, the exact method is only applicable to a limited range of data, and heuristic methods can be less accurate and also slow sometimes. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for constructing near parsimonious networks for multiple binary gene trees.

EdgeChain operates on a decentralized approach that counts on the blockchain services provided by the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The network offers enhanced security features that leverage the permissioned nature of Fabric, more specifically, it relies on Fabric’s membership service to validate identities and allowed behavior of participant nodes in the network. This design choice restrains external attackers from interfering with the normal operation of the task sharing scheme. The network also offers enhanced privacy features powered by a smart contract design that makes use of multiple decoupled Fabric channels with separate operation rules, ledgers, and peer-to-peer communication networks. This design choice guarantees that the computational tasks circulating in the network are only exposed to servers participating in task sharing services. The trait prevents other servers in the network to have access to private tasks and their data.

The secure network-coding scheme we offer is hybrid in the sense that it combines information-theoretic security with public-key cryptography. In addition, the scheme is general and can be applied to any communication network, and to any public-key cryptosystem. Our hybrid scheme is based on the information theoretic notion of individual secrecy, which traditionally relies on the assumption that an eavesdropper can only observe a subset of the communication links between the trusted parties - an assumption that is often challenging to enforce. For this setting, several code constructions have been developed, where the messages are linearly mixed before transmission over each of the paths in a way that guarantees that an adversary which observes only a subset has sufficient uncertainty about each individual message. Instead, in this article, we take a computational viewpoint, and construct a coding scheme in which an arbitrary secure cryptosystem is utilized on a subset of the links, while a pre-processing similar to the one in individual security is utilized. Under this scheme, we demonstrate 1) a computational security guarantee for an adversary which observes the entirety of the links 2) an information theoretic security guarantee for an adversary which observes a subset of the links, and 3) information rates which approach the capacity of the network and greatly improve upon the current solutions. A perhaps surprising consequence of our scheme is that, to guarantee a computational security level b, it is sufficient to encrypt a single link using a computational post-quantum scheme. That is, using HUNCC, we can ensure post-quantum security in networks where it is not possible to use public-key encryption over all the links in the network. In addition, the information rate approaches 1 as the number of communication links increases. As a concrete example, in a multipath network with three links, using a 128-bit computationally secure McEliece cryptosystem only over one link, we obtain a 128-bit individually computationally secure level over all paths with a total information rate of 0.91 in the network."",""2641-8770"","""",""10.1109/JSAIT.2021.3054598"",""ERDF—European Regional Development Fund under the Project SNOB-5G: Scalable Network Backhauling for 5G(grant numbers:CENTRO-01-0247-FEDER-045929)"; Operational Program for Competitiveness and Internationalisation—COMPETE 2020, the Center Portugal Regional Operational Program—CENTRO 2020, and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology—FCT under the MIT Portugal Program;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335952"",""Post quantum cryptography";cryptography;information-theoretic security;secure network coding;public key;encryption;communication system security;"secure distributed storage"",""Cryptography";Security;Encryption;Encoding;Public key cryptography;Physical layer security;"Information rates"","""",""33"","""",""96"",""IEEE"",""26 Jan 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, mmWave signals have high distance attenuation and are easily blocked by obstacles. In urban scenarios, the prevalent None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) situations have severe impacts on positioning accuracy. The multipath effects, Doppler effects, and tracking lags further degrade the performance. To address these issues, we introduce the Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) to single BS vehicle positioning for beyond Line-of-Sight (LoS) communications. We study the advantages of IRS in urban ITS to alleviate the multipath effects, Doppler effects, and tracking delay. To realize the real-time target tracking for IRS, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is adopted, for which stable communications between the BS and moving vehicle can be maintained.

Besides, the model maximizes the utilities of crowdsourcing participants by reaching the game equilibrium. Secondly, we design a reputation management system based on a consortium blockchain to abstract management activities as transactions and verify them by executing smart contracts, which meet multi-party management and reputation verification needs. Moreover, we design a half-committee endorsement strategy to improve system performance. Finally, our model is verified by simulation, and it can better suppress malicious and selfish behaviors compared with three different reputation models.

Firstly, the spectrum opportunity (SOP) related information is layered into the spectrum data, the spectrum information and the spectrum knowledge based on the processing and abstractive level. The spectrum knowledge is formally defined as the extendible and scalable information to reason and predict the SOP usability as well as the outcome of the SOP occupancy. Then the smart spectrum model (SSM) is proposed with the spectrum knowledge as the key enabler and the coupled SOP exploration and exploitation as the core feature. Under the SSM framework, the spectrum knowledge and real-time observing (SKRO) enabled SOP exploration scheme is designed, which can make use of both the historical information and the real-time sensing information for smart SOP exploration. Extensive simulations are provided which demonstrate that the SKRO enabled SSM can achieve much better SOP utilization while satisfying the required legacy assurance.

On this basis, we achieve efficient multi-keyword subset retrieval and dynamic update with insignificant information disclosure in the smart grid. Furthermore, our MSIAP strengthens the present data retrieval methods and enormously reduces the time complexity to accommodate the system of distributed smart grid.

In this paper, we propose secure index based on counting Bloom filter (CBF) for ranked multiple keywords search. In the proposed scheme, several algorithms are designed to maintain and lookup CBF, while a pruning algorithm is used to delete the repeated items for saving the space. Besides, the relevance scores are encrypted by the Paillier cryptosystem. It ensures that the same relevance scores are encrypted into different bits, which can resist the statistical analyses on the ciphertext of the relevance scores. Moreover, since the Paillier cryptosystem supports the homomorphic addition of ciphertext without the knowledge of the private key, the major computing work in ranking could be moved from user side to the cloud server side. Therefore, the proposed scheme has huge potentials in resource-constraint mobile devices such as 5G mobile terminals.

First, user privacy cannot be guaranteed when messages are forwarded anonymously, thus the reliability of these messages is in question. Second, users often lack interest in responding to announcements. To address these problems, we introduce a Blockchain-based incentive announcement system called PIAS. This system enables anonymous message commitment in a semi-trusted environment and encourages witnesses to respond to requests for traffic information. Additionally, PIAS uses blockchain accounts as identities to participate in the system with incentives, ensuring privacy in anonymous announcements. PIAS successfully protects the privacy of participants and motivates witnesses to respond to requests.

Although with significant importance, the traditional signal map construction, e.g., through full site survey, could be time-consuming and labor-intensive as the signal varies frequently over time and the accuracy requirement grows rapidly with the emergence of new applications. The state-of-the arts usually employ crowdsourcing scheme and matrix completion algorithm to solve the dilemma. However, the crowdsourcing scheme usually suffers from uneven distributed and inadequate participants, while the matrix completion methods do not take the specific signal map features into account, thus suffering from sub-optimal recovery results. To this end, in this paper, we study how to effectively reconstruct and update the signal map in the case of partially measured signal maps with smaller cost and propose a GAN-based active signal map reconstruction method (GSMAC). Our method is mainly innovative in two parts: GSMC, GAN-based signal map construction, and ACS, an active crowdsourcing scheme. Specifically, GSMC can effectively update the signal map with only a small number of observations while also fully using the incomplete historical signals to effectively update the signal map online. Meanwhile, ACS consists of a reinforce learning-based active query mechanism which quantitatively evaluates the most valuable measurement site for reconstruction, which further reduces the measurement cost to minimum.

Nevertheless, due to the continuous departure of existing nodes and the arrival of newcomers, the missing cached data may lead to permanent data loss. In this study, we propose and analyze a class of Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes for distributed data caching in cellular networks. Contrary to traditional distributed storage, a novel repair algorithm for LDPC codes is proposed which is designed to exploit the minimal direct BS communication. To assess the versatility of LDPC codes and establish performance comparisons to classic coding techniques, novel theoretical and experimental evaluations are derived. Essentially, the theoretical/numerical results for repair bandwidth cost in presence of BS are presented in a distributed caching setting. Accordingly, when the gap between the cost of downloading a symbol from BS and from other local network nodes is not dramatically high, we demonstrate that LDPC codes can be considered as a viable fault-tolerance alternative in cellular systems with caching capabilities for both low and high code rates."",""1558-0857"","""",""10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118027"",""TUBITAK(grant numbers:119E235)"; Pamukkale University Scientific Research Projects Department(grant numbers:2018FEBE009);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559994"",""Network coding";cellular systems;Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC);coded caching;distributed systems;"5G and beyond"",""Maintenance engineering";Parity check codes;Costs;Distributed databases;Bandwidth;Cellular networks;"Encoding"","""",""4"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""5 Oct 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recent advances in wireless broadband and multimedia services have evolved PSNs extensively. Third generation partnership project long term evolution (3GPP-LTE) becomes a basic platform for deploying public safety networks around the world. There have been extensive studies on LTE-based PSNs satisfying mission-critical requirements. However, most studies focus on investigating PSNs with network infrastructure, and there is little progress on infrastructure-less PSNs, where base stations and network coordinators become destroyed or impaired. This paper focuses on infrastructure-less PSNs, where battery-powered individual IoT devices cooperate to construct the network without any central coordination. It is aimed at maximizing the network survival time of the IPSN while satisfying mission-critical requirements. A highly nonlinear nature of the network construction problem with several constraints renders the optimization task very challenging. In addition, no coordinator exists in IPSNs and all nodes are subject to the identification of distributed strategy to achieve the goal. To this end, a state-of-the-art message-passing framework is introduced to develop a novel distributed algorithm. The major benefit originates from the controllability of the limit on wireless link hops to meet the data reliability and transmission latency required for mission-critical IPSNs. We also establish the proof on the optimality. The proposed technique converges rapidly and keeps the computation load per IoT device low, which makes it attractive for practical implementation.

The BP scheme of BIPCM can combine multiple independent polar subcodes to form a longer polar code under the block polarization between polar subcodes. The BP scheme of HARQ further carries out block polarization based on the BP scheme of BIPCM, which can combine multiple transmitted BP schemes of BIPCM together to form a longer polar code. When the underlying channels are non-uniform, such as the polarization effect of high-order modulation will lead to non-uniform reliabilities, it is not suitable to use the fixed sequence (e.g., the polarization weight (PW) sequence or Polar sequence in the 5G standard) to construct polar codes. The underlying channels on each polar subcode have uniform reliability by dividing different blocks according to the reliabilities of the underlying channel. Based on this characteristic of BP scheme, we propose a rate-allocation (RA) method to study fast code construction of BP scheme. The key idea of the proposed RA method is finding out the equivalent channel whose average symmetric capacity equals the target transmission rate. The allocated rates are computed according to the symmetric capacities of split channels under the block polarization between polar subcodes. Then the ranking of bit indices within each polar subcode can be obtained by fixed sequence. In this way, the RA code construction is concise and robust for diverse configurations which are the desired features for practical implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed BP scheme under RA construction can achieve almost identical performance as the Gaussian approximation construction with much lower complexity."",""1558-0857"","""",""10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3216040"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92067202,62071058,62001049)"; Major Key Project of Peng Cheng Laboratory(grant numbers:PCL2021A15);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925158"",""Polar codes";BIPCM;HARQ;block polarization;"rate-allocation"",""Codes";Polar codes;Reliability;Modulation;Encoding;Symbols;"Decoding"","""","""","""",""27"",""IEEE"",""19 Oct 2022"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Within a UAV swarm, the design of routing protocol is one of the most challenging problems that enables cooperation among multiple UAVs to perform complex tasks in disaster areas. Nevertheless, the routing protocols reported so far have made the simplifying assumption that UAVs move randomly. In the context of mission-oriented scenarios, such as emergency communication in disaster areas, this assumption appears evidently impractical. On the contrary, for many UAV applications, the trajectories of UAVs are pre-planned. Disregarding trajectory information may result in routing protocols struggling to adapt to rapid changes in network topology. To break the bottleneck, we propose an efficient trajectory-based optimized routing protocol (TORP) for mission-oriented UAV swarm. Firstly, we model the packet routing problem using the concept of time-dependent graph. The objective is to maximize network performance, considering the power consumption and end-to-end (E2E) delay. The formulated problem is a binary linear programming (BLP) problem which is intractable to solve. Firstly, we propose a modified dynamically weighted Dijkstra's algorithm (MDWD). Based on the MDWD algorithm, we further propose an efficient optimization scheme to solve the problem.

Traditional open-pit mine transportation systems rely on human power for command, which often causes vehicle delay and congestion. The operation of unmanned vehicles in an open pit mine relies on many sensors. Using big data from the sensors, we optimize vehicle paths and build an efficient intelligent transportation system. Based on large amounts of data, such as unmanned vehicle GPS data, vehicle equipment information, production plan data, etc., with the goal of reducing vehicle transportation costs, total unmanned vehicle delay time, and ore content fluctuation rate, a multi-objective intelligent scheduling model for open-pit mine unmanned vehicles was established, and it is aligned with actual open pit mine production. Next, we use artificial intelligence algorithms to solve the scheduling problem. To improve the convergence, distribution and diversity of the classical fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve constrained high-dimensional multi-objective problems, we propose a decomposition-based constrained dominance principle genetic algorithm (DBCDP-NSGA-II), retaining feasible and non-feasible solutions in sparse areas, and compare it with four other commonly-used multi-objective optimization algorithms. Simulation analysis shows our algorithm provides the best overall performance results of the multi-objective models. Furthermore, we apply intelligent scheduling models and optimization algorithms to mining practice and obtain new truck operation routes and schedules, reducing truck operation costs by 18.2%, truck waiting time by 55.5%, and ore content fluctuation by 40.3%. For open-pit mine unmanned transportation, the approach provides a variety of optimized solutions for minimum transportation costs, minimum waiting time, minimum ore content fluctuation rate, and a balance of the three indicators. Through an artificial intelligence algorithm, this study realizes intelligent unmanned vehicle path planning and improves the operation efficiency of open-pit mine intelligent transportation systems."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011109"",""Natural Science Foundation of China, title: “Research on Intelligent Fusion and situation assessment of multi-source heterogeneous flow data of rock failure in underground metal mines”(grant numbers:51974223)"; title: “Research on 5D refined mining production scheduling model and collaborative optimization method in metal open pit under constraints of Grade-Price-Cost”(grant numbers:51774228); title: “Experimental theory and method of time-varying calculation for fully mechanized mining process under artificial system environment in Yushen mining area”(grant numbers:51864046); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, title: “Research and development of key technologies for intelligent production control and intelligent decision-making of open pit coal mine under cloud service”(grant numbers:2019JLP-16); title: “Integrated intelligent scheduling model of driverless multi vehicle cooperation in metal open pit under time and space road conditions(grant numbers:2020JC-44);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146106"",""Intelligent transportation system";traffic big data;unmanned driving;intelligent scheduling;NSGA-II;"open-pit mine"",""Unmanned vehicles";Optimal scheduling;Production;Dispatching;Ores;"Computational modeling"","""",""38"","""",""44"",""CCBY"",""22 Jul 2020"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Under strong background noises, the proposed scheme improves the recognition rate of primary users (PUs) than that of the current blind spectrum sensing. First, the ratio of the maximum-to-minimum eigenvalue of a covariance matrix obtained by the Cholesky decomposition is used to construct the statistics. Second, the statistics are labeled with “+1” or “-1,” namely, the energy characteristics of the training samples are extracted and marked with “+1” for PUs and “-1” for noises. Finally, an RBF-SVM classification model, with an intelligent RBF as the SVM kernel function, is obtained by training the above-mentioned statistics and the labels. Thus, the received signals are classified as PUs or not be trained in the SVM model. The threshold possesses self-learning ability, and it distinguishes PU signals from noises effectively. The classification among PU signals and noises is implemented by the optimal SVM decision boundary, derived from maximizing the margin of the decision boundary of trained samples for efficient detection. In addition, the complexity of the statistic construction is lower than that of the conventional maximum minimum eigenvalue (MME). The simulation results show that the RBF in our scheme has 77.5% accuracy at -10 dB, and it outperforms linear kernel function significantly by about 27.5% in accuracy at -10 dB. In addition, the average error probability of the proposed scheme is reduced by about 26% when compared with those of original SVM schemes at -20 dB.

This requires heavy usage of advanced deep learning techniques in a closed-loop way to auto-build the suitable decisions, enabling to meet network slices’ requirements. In this context, Federated Learning (FL) is playing a vital role in training deep learning models in a collaborative way among thousands of network slice participants while ensuring their privacy and hence network slice isolation. Specifically, running network slices may share only their model parameters with a central entity, e.g., Inter Domain Slice Manager, to aggregate them and build a global model. Thus, the central entity does not directly access the training data. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where an insider participant may upload poisoning updates to the central entity so that it can cause a construction failure of the global model and thus affect its global performance. Therefore, it is crucial to design security means to detect and mitigate such threats. In this paper, we design a novel framework to automatically detect malicious participants in the FL process. In particular, our framework first uses a deep reinforcement algorithm to dynamically select a network slice as a trusted participant, based mainly on its reputation. The selected participant will then be in charge of identifying poisoning model updates by leveraging unsupervised machine learning. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework on top of a real dataset that we generate using the 5G OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform.

Different from the conventional spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes, the proposed BMST-LDPC codes can have encoder/decoder implemented using the structure of the corresponding LDPC-BCs. The proposed construction is universal, which is applicable to any existing LDPC-BCs including the 5 G New Radio (5G-NR) LDPC-BCs to obtain extra coding gains. The proposed BMST-LDPC codes are also a special class of BMST codes, which have lower error floors even with an encoding memory of one, inheriting a low decoding latency. Moreover, partial superposition, where a fraction of the coded bits are superimposed onto the following codewords, is introduced to alleviate the decoding error propagation. The construction can be optimized, for random long codes, by a protograph-based extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis, or by a one-dimensional search for structured block codes. Furthermore, the BMST-LDPC scheme is integrated with the hybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) over the block fading channel, improving the throughput performance. Numerical results are presented to validate our analysis and demonstrate the performance advantage of the BMST-LDPC codes over the LDPC-BCs.

In addition, the combined efficiency and information integration advantages of big data are conducive to the construction of a comprehensive and three-dimensional traffic information system and can enhance traffic prediction. However, such substantial sensitive data, mainly on the cloud infrastructure, exposes several vulnerabilities like data leakages and privacy breaks, especially when data is shared for cooperative learning purposes. To address this, this paper proposes a forward privacy-preserving scheme, named AFFIRM, for multi-party encrypted sample alignment adopting cooperative learning in C-ITS. By introducing the searchable encryption method, we realize the sample alignment of cooperative learning in the multi-party encrypted data space. AFFIRM ensures encrypted sample alignment under the condition of forward privacy security. We have formally proved that the proposed scheme satisfies both forward security and validity.

Presently, prevailing methods for ESC predominantly center on the prioritization of Quality of Service (QoS) optimization, presenting a solitary optimal composite service for consumer electronics invocation. Regrettably, this approach sidelines the significance of solution diversity within composite services, potentially resulting in service overload and the suboptimal utilization of edge resources.

Since quantization is a critical implementation issue, in this paper, a nonuniform quantization method is proposed for the successive cancellation (SC) decoder of polar codes, which finds quantization boundary values based on the analysis of various quantization levels over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. Since low computational complexity, high reliability, and efficient memory management are required in the next-generation communication and memory systems, 2-4 bit precision levels are mainly considered in the proposed nonuniform quantization method. Depending on the presence of erasure, quantization levels are divided into three types, and the message alphabets and update rules are derived for each type. Also, a construction method of polar codes suitable for the proposed nonuniform-quantized SC decoder is proposed, which simultaneously determines the information set and the quantization boundary values based on the density evolution analysis and an upper bound of the block error probability. To determine quantization boundary values, a multivariate objective function is defined and an iterative coarse-to-fine search algorithm to minimize this objective function is proposed. In addition, a scaling method of quantizer output values is proposed when the number of quantization levels of quantizer is smaller than the number of quantization levels of decoder. Finally, simulation results confirm that the proposed nonuniform-quantized SC decoder shows better error-correction performance, lower decoding complexity, and higher memory efficiency compared to the best known uniform-quantized SC decoder."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3084627"",""Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) Grant by the Korean Government [Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE)] through the Human Resources Development (HRD) Program for Industrial Innovation(grant numbers:P0017011)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9443194"",""Block error probability";density evolution;iterative coarse-to-fine search algorithm;minimization problem;nonuniform quantization;polar codes;"successive cancellation decoding"",""Quantization (signal)";Decoding;Polar codes;Iterative decoding;Encoding;Sensors;"Computational complexity"","""",""2"","""",""31"",""CCBY"",""28 May 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since most applications require vehicles to report perceived information to nearby base stations, how to defend against malicious attacks and selfish behaviors of vehicles in reporting activities has become an essential security issue. Some researchers have attempted to encourage vehicles to actively report information by establishing reputations for them, but these efforts have some shortcomings. In model design, they neither verify the basis and process of reputation evaluation nor pay attention to the diversity and intelligence of vehicle behaviors. In system construction, they fail to meet the management needs of multi-party participation and provide verifiable reputation management services. In this paper, we propose $\mathcal{R}$-tracing, a consortium blockchain-based vehicle reputation management scheme. The main contribution of our work lies in three points. First, a vehicle reputation model is designed with a reward and punishment mechanism and a regular tax mechanism. Second, a vehicle reputation management system is constructed by multiple organizations, in which all tasks of reputation update are abstracted into three types of transactions. Finally, the effectiveness of $\mathcal{R}$-tracing is verified by extensive simulations running on a large-scale traffic scenario and performance evaluation on a prototype system. Compared with the typical linear reputation model, our model not only resists the usual malicious attack and selfish behavior but also effectively deals with the on-off attack and rational selfish behavior. In the throughput test, $\mathcal{R}$-tracing achieves 600tps, outperforming two state-of-the-art schemes."",""1939-9359"","""",""10.1109/TVT.2023.3238507"",""National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005500)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702288); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Southeast university;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024000"",""Vehicle reputation management";consortium blockchain;5G Internet of Vehicles;malicious attacks;"selfish behaviors"",""Behavioral sciences";Transportation;Resists;Blockchains;Task analysis;Intelligent vehicles;"Analytical models"","""",""9"","""",""37"",""IEEE"",""20 Jan 2023"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Motivated by the hard delay requirement for URLLC, we aim at devising medium access control (MAC) schemes that can guarantee packet transmissions within a bounded delay. The model we considered is a multi-channel single-hop ad hoc network in which each node has packets to broadcast to other nodes. This broadcast scenario is common, and has been extensively studied in various scenarios such as safety message broadcast in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Most of the existing MAC schemes employ backoff algorithms to handle transmission failures caused by channel collisions, and thus cannot provide a hard guarantee on transmission delay. Moreover, these schemes rely on time synchronization and coordination among the nodes, which would cause heavy overhead for control message exchange. In this paper, we focus on devising MAC schemes to provide a hard guarantee on broadcast delay, without time synchronization and cooperation among the nodes. We employ the sequence scheme in which each node is pre-assigned a periodic sequence to schedule transmissions and receptions at each time slot. These sequences are referred to as schedule sequences. Since each node starts its transmission schedule independently, there exist relative time offsets among the schedule sequences they use. Previous sequence schemes for broadcast are only conducted in the single channel context. Our objective is to design schedule sequences such that in a multi-channel system, each node can transmit at least one packet to each of its neighbors successfully within a common period, no matter what the time offsets are. The sequence period should be designed as short as possible. In this paper, we analyze the lower bound on sequence period, and propose a sequence construction method by which the period can achieve the same order as the lower bound. We also consider the random scheme in which each node transmits or receives on a channel at each time slot with a pre-determined probability. The frame length and broadcast completion time under different schemes are compared by numerical studies."",""1939-9359"","""",""10.1109/TVT.2021.3074017"",""Schneider Electric, Lenovo Group (China) Limited and the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund(grant numbers:ITS/066/17FP)"; HKUST-MIT Research Alliance Consortium; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071236); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30920021127); University Development Fund Research Start-Up Fund(grant numbers:UDF01000918); Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408243"",""Schedule sequences";broadcast;URLLC for 5G networks;multi-channel ad hoc networks;"asynchronous systems"",""Delays";Schedules;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Synchronization;Time division multiple access;Quality of service;"Protocols"","""",""4"","""",""42"",""IEEE"",""19 Apr 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It will be difficult to identify the uplink compound interference for the network operator. Meanwhile, the same interference type has flexible frequency location and variable frequency bandwidth. For multiple interference source cases, the classification accuracy and generalization ability of traditional algorithms cannot meet the needs of the actual production environment. Therefore, this paper proposes the FETTrans network to transform the compound interference identification task into a multi-label classification in natural language processing. Inspired by the attention mechanism in Transformer and combined with the pattern recognition task, the correlation between the constructed output vector and input features is obtained through the attention mechanism. On this basis, the network transforms the unidirectional static projection method into a bidirectional dynamic adaptation method, which effectively improves the identification accuracy of the variable compound interference frequency band. After verification by different test sets collected from the current network, the classification accuracy has steadily increased by more than 15%, and the mAP has reached 92%.

The proposed flip-syndrome-list decoder fully parallelizes all constituent code blocks without sacrificing performance, and thus is suitable for ultra-low-latency applications.

This shortcoming yields a series of challenges in 6G DT-enabled positioning, including positioning data acquisition, accuracy enhancement, and continuous optimization. In this regard, we propose a novel paradigm of localization-oriented DT (LocDT) with a compound architecture of 7 sub-DT layers to characterize the 6G integrated-localization-and-communication (ILAC) feature. LocDT starts from a physical environment sublayer to mirror 6G signal interactions within a real-world scenario, along with an ILAC baseband sublayer and a channel frequency Polar-coordinate (CFP) image construction method to provide finer-grained fingerprints. Furthermore, insight from LocDT reveals an interesting phenomenon: the channel features of Line-of-Sight (LoS) / None-Los (NLoS) gNodeBs make differentiated-contributions to positioning accuracy, especially in wide-existing partial-LoS-coverage scenarios. Benefiting from this, a DT-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) positioning model, SSI-Net, is designed with a device-attention mechanism, achieving complementary improvements in accuracy.

In this polar-coded NOMA (PC-NOMA) system, the NOMA transmission is recognized from the novel perspective of channel polarization. Combing the binary polar coding and signal modulation, the original NOMA channel is decomposed into multiple bit polarized channels by using a three-stage channel transform, that is, user-+signal-+bit partitions. Specifically, for the first stage channel transform, we design two schemes, namely the sequential user partition and the parallel user partition (PUP). For the SUP based PC-NOMA system, a “worst-goes-first” strategy is proposed to determine the user partition order which improves the system performance by the enhanced polarization effect among the user synthesized channels. Also, its performance is analyzed by using the channel polarization principle. In the receiver, a joint successive cancellation detection and decoding scheme is developed. For the PUP based PC-NOMA system, a parallel detection scheme is exploited to reduce the processing latency. Furthermore, a round-robin user scheduling is given for the above two PC-NOMA systems, which ensures the user fairness over multiple data blocks. The block error ratio and throughput performances indicate that the proposed PC-NOMA systems obviously outperform the state-of-the-art turbo-coded NOMA systems due to the advantages ofjoint design between the polar coding and the NOMA transmission."",""1941-0476"","""",""10.1109/TSP.2017.2786273"",""BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation(grant numbers:CX2017306)"; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671080); Qualcomm Corporation;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8234623"",""NOMA";polar codes;three-stage channel transform;"polar scheduling"",""NOMA";Transforms;Modulation;Reliability;Receivers;"Turbo codes"","""",""37"","""",""29"",""IEEE"",""22 Dec 2017"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a result, we derive all the feasible solutions for the problem and propose a tight lower bound  $\omega _{LB}$  on the minimum possible maximum column weight to evaluate a solution. Second, we define a metric called layer distance to measure the data dependency between consecutive layers and further illustrate how to identify the solutions with desired layer distance from those achieving the minimum value of  $\omega _{LB}=1$ , which is preferred to reduce computation delay. Next, we demonstrate that up-to-now, finding an optimal solution for the optimization problem with polynomial time complexity is unachievable.

In response, multi-kernel (MK) polar codes have been proposed as a viable solution to achieve increased flexibility in code length. This article proposes unrolled and pipelined architectures for encoding both systematic and nonsystematic MK polar codes, capable of high-throughput encoding of codes constructed with binary, ternary ( $3 \times 3$ ), or binary-ternary mixed kernels. Furthermore, two novel nonsystematic stage-folded encoders, designed to minimize resource usage, have been introduced for the encoding of pure-ternary and MK codes. The proposed MK encoders additionally provide the functionality of dynamic kernel assignment. The proposed architectures exhibit an unprecedented level of flexibility by supporting 83 different codes and offering various architectures that provide tradeoffs between throughput and resource consumption. The FPGA implementation results demonstrate that a partially pipelined polar encoder of size  $N=4096$  operating at a frequency of 270 MHz gives a throughput of 1080 Gb/s.

Therefore, the cyclic prefix (CP) inserted between consecutive optical OFDM blocks, for combating the inter-symbol interference (ISI) induced by chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization-mode-dispersion (PMD), could be removed for optical OFDM/OQAM to promote the system spectral efficiency. The ISI and the inter-carrier-interference (ICI) could be combated by using the filter banks with good time-frequency localization (TFL) property. Thus, the accuracy of channel estimation and system transmission performance largely depend on the TFL property of the filter banks for optical OFDM/OQAM. Recently, numerical experimental demonstrations and theoretical discussions of optical OFDM/OQAM have been reported. However, to our best knowledge, discussions on the TFL property of the filter banks have not been studied for optical OFDM/OQAM to date. In this paper, we systematically analyze the TFL property of the filter banks for optical OFDM/OQAM for the first time. We evaluate the TFL property of the filter banks with energy concentration, orthogonal basis, and isotropic property. Three typical filters as the Gaussian filter, the extended Gaussian function (EGF) filter and the isotropic orthogonal transfer algorithm (IOTA) filter have been employed for comparison. According to our theoretical analysis, with the use of the IOTA filter, optical impairments and channel estimation complexities could be decreased evidently thanks to the promising isotropic property. As shown in the numerous Montel Carlo simulations of the coherent optical OFDM/OQAM, system robustness against IMI, phase noise induced interference (PNII) and nonlinear effect could be improved evidently with the use of the IOTA filter."",""1558-2213"","""",""10.1109/JLT.2019.2936032"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701008)"; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:328201802,328201913); Beijing-Central University Co-Construction Research Project (Advanced Research on DSP for 5G Communication);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805366"",""Filter banks";optical communication;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM/OQAM);"time-frequency localization"",""Integrated optics";Optical polarization;Optical filters;Channel estimation;Time-frequency analysis;Prototypes;"Nonlinear optics"","""",""13"","""",""51"",""IEEE"",""19 Aug 2019"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The vast majority of the existing studies in the area of physical layer security focus exclusively on the scenarios where the channel inputs are Gaussian distributed. However, in practice, the signals employed for transmission are drawn from discrete signal constellations such as phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation. Hence, understanding the impact of the finite-alphabet input constraints and designing secure transmission schemes under this assumption is a mandatory step toward a practical implementation of physical layer security. With this motivation, this paper reviews recent developments on physical layer security with finite-alphabet inputs. We explore transmit signal design algorithms for single-antenna as well as multi-antenna wiretap channels under different assumptions on the channel state information at the transmitter. Moreover, we present a review of the recent results on secure transmission with discrete signaling for various scenarios including multi-carrier transmission systems, broadcast channels with confidential messages, cognitive multiple access and relay networks. Throughout the article, we stress the important behavioral differences of discrete versus Gaussian inputs in the context of the physical layer security.

However, civil GPS services are unencrypted and vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can manipulate UAVs’ location and abort the UAVs’ mission. This paper leverage 3D radio map and machine learning methods to detect and mitigate GPS spoofing attacks for cellular-connected UAVs. Precisely, the edge UAV flight controller uses ray tracing tools deterministic channel models, and Kriging methods to construct a theoretical 3D radio map. Then the machine learning methods, such as text Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), are employed to detect GPS spoofing by analyzing the UAV/base station reported Received Signal Strength (RSS) values and the theoretical radio map RSS values.

The experiment results indicate that the Universal Kriging (UK) with exponential covariance function has the lowest standard errors for radio map construction. Moreover, the MLP achieves the highest spoofing detection accuracy with different spoofing margins because of the statistic prepossessing relieving environmental impacts, while the CNN has a comparable detection accuracy with less training time than MLP since CNN inputs are raw RSS data.

While enjoying the convenience brought by IoT, we also face unprecedented challenges, including ubiquitous and unpredictable demands for communication and computing resources. In consideration of their flexible deployment, low cost, and easy expansion, UAV edge computing IoT networks (UECINs), which adopt unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide fast communication and computing services, have emerged as a promising solution. Note that there have been a number of studies focusing on UAV’s position deployment and trajectory design, resource allocation in UECIN. However, most existing works proposed short-term service provisioning systems with a fixed number of UAVs, ignoring the problem of UAVs’ limited battery power and the possible changes of ground users’ number, locations, and resource requirements. To address these issues, we present a dynamic UECIN framework with autonomous prediction characteristics, aiming to stably provide mobile-edge computing services for ground users in a certain area over a long period of time. This framework can not only support UAV’s dynamic entry and exit according to the real-time needs of ground users but also update their position deployment based on the distribution of ground users. As we know, we are the first to propose UECIN with a dynamic entry and exit mechanism.

To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus.

However, its attack surface is expanded with the increased fusion of various functional interfaces, leading to easier penetration of vehicles. To deal with endless vehicle attacks, scholars propose many methods, where intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important branch. However, many IDSs are based on characteristics of single or specific types of vehicles, which limits model transplantation. Besides, 1-D features are usually utilized in existing IDSs, such as time, traffic, or voltage, etc., limiting the ability to detect attacks related to other dimensions. What is more, many IDSs harness machine learning algorithms and are deployed in vehicles simultaneously, which aggravates the computational burden. Therefore, we devise a cloud-vehicle collaborative IDS based on multidimensional features (CVMIDS) for IoV, called CVMIDS. It solves the problem of data heterogeneity by abstracting different vehicle data to the same feature space. Thus, data sets from different vehicles can be fed into one model for multiclassification, which naturally solves the problem of model transplantation. The feature space is established by combining features in dimensions of time, traffic, and voltage, thereby extending the types of attacks that CVMIDS can detect. Due to the deviated location of abnormal data in feature space compared with normal data, CVMIDS will misclassify vehicle data. Hence, CVMIDS can detect intrusions based on multiclassifying vehicles.

In particular, the controller area network (CAN) protocol, a typical IVN responsible for electronic control unit cooperation, lacks defense mechanisms like encryption or authentication, further making vehicles vulnerable to intrusion. Therefore, many scholars propose countermeasures to address the weakness of CAN, namely message authentication and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Given that the former may occupy extra bandwidth and computational resources, we prioritize IDS in this paper. Thus, we propose a generative adversarial network assisted contextual pattern-aware IDS (GPIDS) against several typical vehicle attacks, including bus-off, spoofing, masquerade, replay, fuzzy, and same origin method execution (SOME). The SOME attack stems from the Internet of Things field and possesses high disguise property, which can mimic physical features as normal messages in IVN, like clock skew, traffic, voltage, and so on.

However, current research lacks real-time detection methods for grape leaf diseases, which cannot ensure the healthy growth of grape plants. To improve the accuracy of grape leaf disease detection and enable easy deployment of the model on mobile devices, this study proposes a lightweight grape leaf disease detection method based on improved YOLOv8.Firstly, the AKConv module is employed to enable arbitrary sampling of targets of various sizes, replacing traditional convolutional (Conv) modules, thereby reducing model parameters and enhancing disease detection. Secondly, the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism is introduced at the end and neck of the backbone network, embedding positional information into channel attention to strengthen feature extraction capabilities and suppress irrelevant feature interference. Next, the lightweight Content-aware Reassembly of Features (CARAFE) module is introduced to improve the model’s ability to extract important features. Lastly, the Wise-IoU (Weighted Interpolation of Sequential Evidence for Intersection over Union) boundary loss function replaces the original loss function, enhancing the network’s bounding box regression performance and detection accuracy for small target diseases. The experimental results on a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that the improved YOLOv8-ACCW exhibits strong detection capabilities for small target disease regions. In the identification of grape leaf lesions, the model achieved F1 scores, mAP50, and mAP50-95 values of 92.4%, 92.8%, and 73.8%, respectively. Compared to the original algorithm, these metrics represent improvements of 3.1%, 3.1%, and 5.6%, respectively. The model’s parameter size is only 2.8M, and its computational cost is merely 7.5G, reflecting reductions of 6.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The algorithm’s detection speed reaches 143 FPS, meeting the requirements for real-time detection and enabling the rapid and accurate identification of grape leaf diseases.

Due to its high data rate, low latency, and performance improvement in spectrum and energy efficiency, it has been widely investigated and applied as a critical technology in 5G New Radio (NR). Cooperative D2D communication can achieve a win-win situation between cellular users (CUs) and D2D users (DUs) through cooperative relaying techniques. In addition to conventional overlay and underlay D2D communications, it has attracted extensive attention from academic and industrial circles in the past decade. This paper delves into optimizing joint spectrum allocation, power control, and link-matching between multiple CUs and DUs for cooperative D2D communications. Weighted sum energy efficiency (WSEE) is used as the performance metric to address the challenges of green communication and sustainable development. This mixed-integer fractional programming (MIFP) problem can be decomposed into: 1. a classic weighted bipartite graph matching";" 2. a series of nonconvex spectrum allocation and power control problems between potentially matched cellular and D2D link pairs. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid centralized-distributed scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm. Leveraging the former, the CUs and DUs autonomously optimize spectrum allocation and power control by only utilizing local information. Then, the base station (BS) determines the link matching utilizing the latter. Simulation results reveal that it achieves more than 96% WSEE of the optimal scheme and 98% WSEE of the centralized DRL-based scheme. It significantly enhances the network convergence speed with low centralized computational overheads. In addition, we also propose and utilize cooperative link sets for corresponding D2D links to accelerate the proposed scheme and reduce signaling exchange further: an average of about 85% WSEE of the optimal scheme is achieved, while more than 50% of signaling and distributed computing overheads are reduced."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3521590"",""2023 Scientific Research Plan Guiding Project of Hubei Provincial Department of Education(grant numbers:B2023548)"; Research Platform Construction Project of Hubei Three Gorges Polytechnic(grant numbers:2024KYPT0201); Research Project of Hubei Three Gorges Polytechnic(grant numbers:2024ZX01);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812745"",""Cooperative communication";deep reinforcement learning;device-to-device communication;energy efficiency;power control;"spectrum allocation"",""Device-to-device communication";Resource management;Copper;Wireless communication;Relays;Power control;Interference;Heuristic algorithms;Energy efficiency;"Cellular networks"","""","""","""",""53"",""CCBY"",""23 Dec 2024"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the simultaneous extraction of more salient features and less meaningless details from medical images by using multi-scale transform methods is a challenging task. This study presents a two-scale fusion framework for multimodal medical images to overcome the aforementioned limitation. In this framework, a guided filter is used to decompose source images into the base and detail layers to roughly separate the two characteristics of source images, namely, structural information and texture details. To effectively preserve most of the structural information, the base layers are fused using the combined Laplacian pyramid and sparse representation rule, in which an image patch selection-based dictionary construction scheme is introduced to exclude the meaningless patches from the source images and enhance the sparse representation capability of the pyramid-decomposed low-frequency layer. The detail layers are subsequently merged using a guided filtering-based approach, which enhances contrast level via noise filtering as much as possible. The fused base and detail layers are reconstructed to generate the fused image. We experimentally verify the superiority of the proposed method by using two basic fusion schemes and conducting comparison experiments on nine pairs of medical images from diverse modalities. The comparison of the fused results in terms of visual effect and objective assessment demonstrates that the proposed method provides better visual effect with an improved objective measurement because it effectively preserves meaningful salient features without producing abnormal details."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3013027"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61763018)"; 03 Special Project and 5G Program of Science and Technology Department of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20193ABC03A058); Key Foundation of Education Committee of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:GJJ170493,GJJ190451); Program of Qingjiang Excellent Young Talents of the Jiangxi University of Science and Technology;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9152959"",""Medical image fusion";guided filtering;sparse representation;salient features;"meaningless details"",""Image fusion";Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Medical diagnostic imaging;"Transforms"","""",""19"","""",""64"",""CCBY"",""31 Jul 2020"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Instead of relying on expensive labels, we propose to exploit camera and tracklet ids that are automatically obtainable during a Re-id dataset construction. In this article, we present weakly supervised contrastive learning (WSCL) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques using camera and tracklet ids for unsupervised vehicle Re-id. We define each camera id as a subdomain and tracklet id as a label of a vehicle within each subdomain, i.e., weak label in the Re-id scenario. Within each subdomain, contrastive learning using tracklet ids is applied to learn a representation of vehicles. Then, DA is performed to match vehicle ids across the subdomains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for unsupervised vehicle Re-id using various benchmarks.

One particularly important aspect, however, is the configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Assuming that each RIS element is represented by a phase-shift, then the objective of the RIS configuration is to determine the optimum phase-shift combination that maximizes the channel capacity. To this end, we propose a data-driven configuration method for the RIS. In light of the remarkable results recently obtained by machine learning algorithms in wireless communications, it leverages neural network (NN) architectures to configure the RIS phase-shifts. In this work, we investigate the RIS configuration under continuous and discrete phase-shifts, also considering the user equipment (UE) mobility.

In advanced 5G networks and beyond, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology for reducing power consumption in cloud data centers while ensuring reliability and real-time access for end devices. Nonetheless, the inherent complexity and variability of MEC networks present significant challenges in task offloading ( $T_{o}$ ) solutions. This study introduces an optimized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for D2D-assisted task offloading ( $T_{o}$ ) and resource allocation ( $R_{a}$ ) to address these challenges. The process begins with the construction of the MEC network scenario, followed by the implementation of a human evolutionary optimization-aided DRL ( $HEOp-DRL$ ) model to handle task offloading and resource allocation tasks jointly. The HEOp method minimizes time and power consumption constraints while efficiently allocating resources across end devices. The proposed DRL model uses the Markov decision process (MDP) to facilitate collaborative task offloading between end devices and MEC servers, deriving an optimal policy for offloading and resource allocation. The system is simulated on the MATLAB platform, and key performance metrics such as latency, average energy consumption, and sum rate (SR) are analyzed and compared with those of existing methods.

Thus, some important issues have to be solved efficiently, including the cooperation across the administrative domains of a cloud network, the direction-of-arrival (DOA), and a polarization estimation algorithm for a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN). In this paper, the architecture of a battlefield surveillance system is constructed based on mobile cloud computing and 5G link.

The Root-MUSIC algorithm is replaced by the Fourier transform, the former algorithm that can be extended to an arbitrary topology structure of a MWSN.

To support this dynamicity, flex-grid elastic optical networks (EONs) have started to become prolific over the past few years. During the migration from the legacy fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing optical networks to flex-grid EONs, a transition technology called the fixed/flex-grid optical network has become popular. In such fixed/flex-grid networks, the energy consumption caused by serious capacity mismatch between variable IP traffic and the different optical channel capacities is significantly high to be ignored. In fact, energy-efficient traffic grooming (i.e., to aggregate multiple fine-grained IP flows and map them onto a lightpath) is a challenge in IP-over-fixed/flex-grid optical networks because co-existing fixed-grid and flex-grid nodes have different traffic grooming ability and energy consumption models. To overcome the challenge, we propose an auxiliary-graph-based energy-efficient traffic-grooming (EETG) algorithm in IP-over-fixed/flex-grid optical networks for the first time. The construction of an auxiliary graph (AG) model for each connection request is one of the core steps. The well-designed weight-assignment scheme of the AG establishes the relationships between traffic grooming operations and specific energy consumption models. The final traffic grooming operations are undertaken based on the calculated weight-minimized path. The simulation results show that the EETG algorithm achieves 1) the least energy consumption compared with the state-of-the-art traffic grooming algorithms under the non-blocking scenario";" and 2) achieves the tradeoff between energy consumption and blocking probability under the blocking scenario."",""1558-2213"","""",""10.1109/JLT.2021.3057389"",""National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800504)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349123"",""Auxiliary graph";energy efficient;fixed/flex-grid;optical networks;"traffic grooming"",""Optical fiber networks";Energy efficiency;Energy consumption;IP networks;Transponders;Optical fibers;"Resource management"","""",""26"","""",""28"",""IEEE"",""5 Feb 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to the sparse nature of mmWave channel, several users may choose the same beam as the strongest one, leading to severe intra-beam interference (intra-BI). Although intra-BI can be mitigated through digital precoding, the required number of RF chains for fulfilling massive connectivity becomes large. By applying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and properly allocating transmit power to each beam and user, the sum rate can be maximized using a smaller number of RF chains. However, the power allocated to each user depends on that allocated to other users within the same beam. Since the joint beam selection and power allocation problem contains a non-convex objective function with a large set of coupled and mixed integer variables, direct solutions may not exist particularly when both the number of users and antennas are large. In this work, we decompose the aforementioned problem into two subproblems, where the beam selection sub-problem is first solved under an equal power allocation. The outcome of beam selection is then used as the input to the power allocation sub-problem. For both subproblems, we develop numerous efficient algorithms to find the active beam set and the user power allocation, respectively. The notions of embedded methods from machine learning and that of intelligent searching from metaheuristics are adopted in our work as the key ingredient for algorithm constructions. Numerical results demonstrate that in the region of large user population, the proposed beam selection and power allocation algorithms can effectively improve the sum rate using a less number of RF chains in comparison with some existing solutions."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2980880"",""Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2628-E-006-002-MY3)"; Qualcomm;" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9036973"",""Beam selection";metaheuristic;millimeter wave;non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);"power allocation"",""Resource management";NOMA;Radio frequency;Array signal processing;Antenna arrays;Optimization;"Machine learning algorithms"","""",""12"",""1"",""37"",""CCBY"",""16 Mar 2020"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To this end, the idea of spectrum map prediction is introduced. In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum map prediction from historical spectrum observations in the dynamically changing environments. The problem is particularly challenging when the available historical spectrum observations are incomplete and corrupted by anomalies. We propose three techniques to solve the problem. First, we combine the spectrum map with prediction functionalities so as to offer a huge potential for efficient resource management and flexible sharing of resources in dynamically changing environments. Second, by fully exploiting the hidden spatial-temporal-spectral structures of the spectrum data and the sparsity of anomalies and missing data, we model the spectrum map as a 3rd-order spectrum tensor and formulate the spectrum map prediction problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem. Third, we design a robust online spectrum map prediction (ROSMP) algorithm based on the alternating direction minimization method, which derives the tensor decomposition factors for a new timeslot based on the update of existing ones rather than re-computing from the scratch. By gradually learning the hidden spatial-temporal-spectral structures of the spectrum data, ROSMP is able to predict and obtain the complete spectrum map with high accuracy. Finally, extensive numerical evaluations using a real spectrum measurement dataset confirm the efficacy and efficiency of ROSMP and show the superiority of ROSMP over the baselines."",""1558-0660"","""",""10.1109/TMC.2021.3081715"",""National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771126)"; Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BE2018108); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1731238,2030063,CCF 2007313);" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9436034"",""Spectrum map";spectrum prediction;tensor completion;"online learning"",""Tensors";Prediction algorithms;Time-frequency analysis;Sensors;Time series analysis;Forecasting;"Pollution measurement"","""",""9"","""",""43"",""IEEE"",""19 May 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, as the array aperture increases, denser spatial samples are needed for EADF due to large distance offsets of array elements from the reference point in the anechoic chamber, leading to a prohibitive measurement time and increased complexity of EADF. In this article, we present the EADF applied to large-scale arrays and highlight issues caused by the large array aperture.

Traditional automated generating algorithms provide limited-coverage scenarios that do not account for the influence of sensors. Our contributions to solving these issues are as follows. First, we extract the roads in the research region from OpenStreetMap (OSM), filter them, and annotate them using hierarchical clustering of feature values, which creates a static road library. Second, reinforcement learning is used to model dynamic situations using a partly observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in conjunction with sensor inputs. The creation process can be run concurrently with functional tests. Third, the efficiency of simulation testing is increased by integrating the static road library and the dynamic scenario section to produce a sizable library of test scenarios. This increases the realism and coverage of the library.

This traffic is produced by applications in user devices and city services, which engage in local consumption at the city scale through sensor and camera devices using mobile networks. Such increased traffic can compromise the communication speed and stability. To alleviate this burden, traffic offloading becomes a crucial consideration in the beyond-5G era. This paper presents a scheme known as Area-Controlled Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (AMoND). AMoND uses a hierarchical structure of a location layer and an ad-hoc layer to construct area-controlled mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for mutual support of the digital twin and MANETs. AMoND effectively suppresses mobile network traffic by harnessing the digital twin to assist the MANETs during data collection for the digital twin construction. Importantly, the digital twin used in AMoND focuses on the management of node location information and does not need to reproduce the real space on a computer fully. AMoND is not dependent on a specific MANET protocol and can be used as an add-on. AMoND exhibits the ability to reduce traffic volumes by up to approximately 65%, while maintaining arrival rates that are comparable to existing MANET protocols under certain conditions."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3304374"",""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21H04886,JP21K17734)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214544"",""MANETs";location information;traffic load;digital twin;"machine learning"",""Ad hoc networks";Mobile computing;Digital twins;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless communication;Machine learning;"Internet of Things"","""",""5"","""",""47"",""CCBYNCND"",""11 Aug 2023"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The time-domain polyharmonic distortion (TD-PHD) model is discussed first for the behavioral modeling and linearization of PA under mismatch, followed by a practical model construction method. Then, the proposed LMT-DPD technique is derived based on the superposition principle. According to the real-time load reflection coefficients, the LMT-DPD enables automatic and fast adjustments of the predistorter to adapt to the PA’s nonlinear distortion under different load-mismatch conditions without coefficient recalibration. Experimental validations are carried out on a mobile-terminal PA module at 4.6 GHz with a 100-MHz 5G new radio (NR) signal.

In the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands, directional beamforming is essential to the establishment of an efficient radio link for signal transmission. However, in wireless mobile environments, the effective beam direction is generally unavailable in the initial access phase. Hence, beam alignment (BA) is crucial for link establishment in initial access. In this work, we propose an efficient BA technique, referred to as the multi-modal pattern BA scheme, to improve the performance and efficiency of initial access in massive MIMO systems. Unlike the conventional sequential search scheme using single-modal patterns, the transmission of synchronization signals in the proposed scheme is based on the use of multi-modal patterns, each of which specifies multiple main lobes with distinguishable directions. Incomparison with the conventional scheme, our scheme can greatly enhance the achieved angular resolution after BA under the use of a fixed number of synchronization signals. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the established link is significantly improved. By contrast, if the same angular resolution is desired, the proposed scheme can greatly reduce the number of required synchronization signals to conserve the radio resources, including transmission power and bandwidth, and to decrease the searching delay in the BA procedure. In addition, considering multi-modal pattern construction for the transmission using a single radio-frequency (RF) chain, we propose an effective approach to generate the desired beamforming vectors fulfilling the essential constant amplitude constraint."",""1939-9359"","""",""10.1109/TVT.2021.3125003"",""Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2218-E-007-044,MOST 108-2218-E-007-036)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9601297"",""Beam alignment (BA)";massive antenna array;multi-input multi-output (MIMO);beam pattern;"millimeter-wave communications"",""Antenna arrays";Millimeter wave communication;Array signal processing;"Massive MIMO"","""",""4"","""",""30"",""IEEE"",""4 Nov 2021"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its estimation performance is analyzed with closed-form bias and root mean squared error derived. The estimates from the first algorithm are then used to eliminate clock offsets, enabling the construction of angle-Doppler maps.

There are two important factors that impact the performance of turbo codes in general: 1) the convergence behavior of iterative decoding in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 2) the error-floor effect in the high SNR. We thus design the non-binary turbo codes by means of the EXIT charts and truncated union bounds. We first reduce the search space of component recursive convolutional codes by the analysis based on the truncated union bounds in conjunction with the uniform interleaver, followed by its optimization through the EXIT chart analysis. The construction of the EXIT chart for non-binary turbo codes with fixed code coefficients is a non-trivial task by the fact that these messages have multiple parameters to identify. Therefore, we develop a new EXIT chart analysis for non-binary messages which does not rely on any specific message model. It is demonstrated through computer simulations that the well-designed nonbinary turbo codes achieve a better performance than their binary counterparts as well as the conventional non-binary LDPC codes of the same field size. Furthermore, the code design is extended to high-order modulation, and our turbo codes designed for quadrature amplitude modulation are shown to outperform the conventional turbo trellis coded modulation schemes."",""2169-3536"","""",""10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2881243"",""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP16H02345)";" "",""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8534323"",""Turbo codes";non binary codes;EXIT charts;union bounds;"coded modulation"",""Turbo codes";Modulation;Convergence;Iterative decoding;Decoding;"Convolutional codes"","""",""3"","""",""47"",""OAPA"",""14 Nov 2018"","""","""",""IEEE"",""IEEE Journals""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
