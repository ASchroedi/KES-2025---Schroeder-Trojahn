Radiation at these bands can provide non-destructive testing of defects and shielded structures using non-ionizing signals. In an actual building setting where 5G millimeter-wave communications signals are present, passive imaging of the radiation that is propagating through a wall defect can take place by means of interferometric processing without emitting additional signals in an already-crowded spectrum. We investigate the use of millimeter-wave interferometric imaging of defects in building walls and shielded structures by capturing the transmission of 5G millimeter-wave signals through the defects. We experimentally explore the ability to image defects by capturing the transmission of 38 GHz signals through materials using a 24-element interferometric receiving array."",,""This research was funded in part by a Michigan State University Technologies Targeted Support Grant for Technology Development, and in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number 1708820."",Sensors,,Zenghua Liu,,2023-07-14,2023,2023-07-14,,23,14,6421,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Vakalis, Stavros"; Colon-Berrios, Jorge R.; Chen, Daniel;" Nanzer, Jeffrey A."",""Vakalis, Stavros (Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA)"; Colon-Berrios, Jorge R.

When it comes to high data rates, capacity, spectrum efficiency, and availability, 5G mobile broadband goes above and beyond what was previously possible with standard mobile broadband. The construction of 5G networks is still in the planning stages. These 5G networks will create intelligent networked communication environments by connecting people, things, data, applications, and transport networks. Mobile networks have made it possible for customers' mobile devices (such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and so on) to connect to the internet. A variety of distinct protocols will be required to take into consideration the various aspects that 5G possess. One of these is the transport protocol, which is intended to deliver extremely high data transfer rates up to 400 Gbps. The transmission control protocol (TCP) is one of the numerous protocols that are necessary for supporting 5G's many capabilities. Our work focuses on the detection and analysis, on the downlink (DL) side, of the congestion of the transport layer in single- and multicell environments. For the purpose of the analysis, the following metrics were analyzed: physical resource blocks (PRBs), user throughput, cell throughput, cell edge user throughput, and delay. The work emphasizes the activation of the TCP slow-start algorithm using file transfer protocol (FTP) model two according to 3GPP standards."",This paper was financially supported by the project “Network of excellence in applied research and innovation for doctoral and postdoctoral programs”/InoHubDoc co-funded by the European Social Fund financing agreement no.

The venues of this Winter Olympics were scattered and the terrain was complex. Moreover, the medical resources of Hebei and Beijing were relatively unbalanced. In the medical security of major events, the connection between first aid and in-hospital processes is of the utmost importance to rescue quality. 5th generation mobile network (5G) applications in medical scenarios are on the rise. It would be of great relevance to fully use 5G’s low-latency and high-speed features to share the process information of patients, ambulance personnel, and the destination hospital’s rescue team at emergency scenes and in transportation, improving rescue efficiency. This paper proposes a system scheme of cross-institutional emergency health information sharing based on 5G and augmented reality wearable devices. It also integrates the construction method of monitoring and other sign data sharing, in addition to testing the proposed scheme’s service quality in 5G environments. In the deployment area of the 5G emergency medical rescue information sharing scheme for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, we selected two designated medical support institutions for testing. The test adopted a combination of fixed-point and driving tests to experiment on the service data, voice service, and streaming media indicators. The 5G signal's coverage rate was close to 100%, the standalone connection's success rate was 100%, and the drop rate was 0. The average downlink rate of multiple scenarios was 620mbps, and the average uplink rate of 5G was over 71.8mbps, which is higher than the average 5G level in China. The downlink rate was more than 20 times larger than the 4th generation mobile network (4G) rate. This study’s proposed scheme demonstrates the importance of 5G applications in emergency response and support, in addition to providing a suitable scheme for the integration of 5G networks in the medical scene."",,This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2021YFF0307305).,Scientific Reports,,,Humans"; Augmented Reality; Ambulances; First Aid; Information Dissemination; China,2023-04-18,2023,2023-04-18,,13,1,6353,All OA;" Gold,Article,""Wang, Mengying"; Ji, Hong; Jia, Mo; Sun, Zhen; Gu, Jinyi;" Ren, Haiying"",""Wang, Mengying (Information Management and Big Data Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China)"; Ji, Hong (Information Management and Big Data Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China); Jia, Mo (Information Management and Big Data Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China); Sun, Zhen (Information Management and Big Data Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China); Gu, Jinyi (Information Management and Big Data Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China);" Ren, Haiying (China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, Beijing, China)"",""Ji, Hong (Peking University Third Hospital)"",""Wang, Mengying (Peking University Third Hospital)"; Ji, Hong (Peking University Third Hospital); Jia, Mo (Peking University Third Hospital); Sun, Zhen (Peking University Third Hospital); Gu, Jinyi (Peking University Third Hospital);" Ren, Haiying (China Academy of Information and Communications Technology)"",7,7,0.33,6.33,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33610-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157330703,37 Earth Sciences"; 3704 Geoinformatics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For the first time, in this research a dual-post band-pass filter is designed and simulated in a three-layer substrate integrated gap groove waveguide (SIGGW) for 5G millimeter-wave frequency band applications. The filter includes 12 posts (6×2$$6 \times 2$$). Also, the structure facilitates to use resonant posts and so we can design the posts to add a transmission zero in lower rejection band. The design theory algorithm and its limitations are investigated based on the circuit model of filter.

Link prediction can provide throughput guidance for MEC and select appropriate c nodes through the MEC routing links of 5G/6G access networks. Traditional link prediction algorithms are always based on node similarity, which needs predefined similarity functions, is highly hypothetical and can only be applied to specific network structures without generality. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new efficient link prediction algorithm PLAS (predicting links by analysis subgraph) and its GNN (graph neural network) version PLGAT (predicting links by graph attention networks) based on the target node pair subgraph. In order to automatically learn the graph structure characteristics, the algorithm first extracts the h-hop subgraph of the target node pair, and then predicts whether the target node pair will be linked according to the subgraph. Experiments on eleven real datasets show that our proposed link prediction algorithm is suitable for various network structures and is superior to other link prediction algorithms, especially in some 5G MEC Access networks datasets with higher AUC (area under curve) values."",,""This research was funded by the 173 Basic Foundation Reinforcement Project of China (No. JSLY-A12017) for network analysis, the China National Key Research and Development Project (No. 2021YFB3101900), and the Key Technology Project of Shenzhen City, under the 2021 Research and Development of Key Edge Computing Gateway Technology Based on 5G (No. JSGG20201103092802010), project director Zhou Yong (mario@jcg.com.cn)."",Sensors,,Stefano Savazzi,,2023-05-20,2023,2023-05-20,,23,10,4936,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Deng, Xiaolong"; Sun, Jufeng;" Lu, Junwen"",""Deng, Xiaolong (School of Cyberspace Security, Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China"; School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen 361024, China;, jwlu@xmut.edu.cn); Sun, Jufeng (School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China;, sunjufeng@bupt.edu.cn); Lu, Junwen (School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen 361024, China;", jwlu@xmut.edu.cn)"",""Deng, Xiaolong (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications";" Xiamen University of Technology)"",""Deng, Xiaolong (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"; Xiamen University of Technology); Sun, Jufeng (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);" Lu, Junwen (Xiamen University of Technology)"",2,2,,1.45,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/10/4936/pdf?version=1684578180,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158267230,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has aroused extensive academic and policy interests in recent years, especially due to its beneficial role in empowering regional novel economic dynamics. However, this argument is still too general to capture the nuanced effects of new infrastructure construction on fostering emerging industries in specific spatial-temporal and industrial contexts, which is left for geographers to take up. This paper focuses on the spatial-temporally and industrially heterogeneous effects of new infrastructure construction on fostering four distinctive emerging industries in major Chinese cities over the last decade. It reveals that new infrastructure construction and emerging industries have experienced rapid development in major Chinese cities, with geographical agglomeration in national central cities with advanced economic development level. It is empirically demonstrated that new infrastructure construction can facilitate the development of emerging industries in major Chinese cities, while significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity characterizes the contributory forces. Furthermore, artificial intelligence as a Key Enabling Technology, robotics as a kind of hardware-featured industry, software-as-a-service as a software-centered industry, and blockchain as a networking-oriented industry vary markedly in the extent and the ways in which they benefit from new infrastructure construction, and they consequently exhibit industrial sensitivity to spatial-temporal heterogeneity in the fostering effects."",Declaration of competing interest None.,This research was funded by the Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China (21ZD107).,Heliyon,,,,2023-12-15,2023,2023-12-15,2024-01,10,1,e23774,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Xu, Jili"; Huang, Guan; Ye, Yuyao;" Liu, Zhengqian"",""Xu, Jili (Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510070, China)"; Huang, Guan (Department of Urban Planning and Design, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China); Ye, Yuyao (Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510070, China);" Liu, Zhengqian (Guangzhou Institute of Geography, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510070, China)"",""Ye, Yuyao (Guangdong Academy of Sciences)"",""Xu, Jili (Guangdong Academy of Sciences)"; Huang, Guan (University of Hong Kong); Ye, Yuyao (Guangdong Academy of Sciences);" Liu, Zhengqian (Guangdong Academy of Sciences)"",1,1,,0.91,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23774,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167052319,33 Built Environment and Design"; 44 Human Society;" 4406 Human Geography,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To perform this, a fast and secure slicing technique is employed for node allocation and connection establishment, which necessitates the usage of a large number of domain applications across the network. PROMETHEE-II and SLE algorithms were used in this study's approach to network design for node allocation and link construction, respectively. The PROMETHEE-II approach takes into account a variety of node characteristics while constructing a node importance rank array (NIRA), including the node capacity, bandwidth of neighboring connections, degree of the node, and proximity centrality among others. The SLE method is proposed to record all possible link configurations for the network slice request (NSR) nodes to guarantee that the shortest path array (SPA) of the NSR has a high acceptance rate. Performance metrics such as the service revenue and acceptance ratio were considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested approach. The effectiveness of network slicing has been further examined under different infrastructure models to determine whether a small-world network structure is beneficial to 5G network.

This process is repeated until the design is optimized. Three types of parametric analysis are considered, including variations in length, widths of sickle-shaped patches, and varying sizes of DGS. The frequency range of 2–8 GHz is used for structural investigation. The − 18.77 dB of return loss was observed at 3.825 GHz for a single-element structure. The optimized one-port structure provides a return loss of − 19.79 dB at 3.825 GHz. The port design offers a bandwidth of 0.71 GHz (3.515–4.225). The four-port design represents two bands that are observed at 3 GHz and 5.43 GHz.

Due to the absence of any published data on a 77 GHz 8 × 8 Butler matrix, the design was validated by developing a 4 × 4 version of the Butler matrix using the same building blocks and comparing the 3D simulation results in ADS with results published elsewhere that showed that the developed Butler matrix offers lower insertion loss in a 10% smaller footprint area. A low-cost microfabrication method has been developed to fabricate the devices using a standard lift-off process. A scaled version of the device can be used for 5G beamforming applications."",""The authors also acknowledge the collaborative research support provided by the IntelliSense Corporation, Lynnfield, MA"; Angstrom Engineering, ON;" and the CMC Microsystems, Canada.

Considering the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises enabled by emerging information technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a Moran process stochastic evolutionary game model of intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises. Based on the fixed point probability of the Moran process, the probability of successful invasion of the """"intelligent construction"""" strategy and the """"traditional production"""" strategy in the limited coal mining enterprise group is calculated. By comparing the probability of individual fixed point and the probability of neutral mutation, the dominant condition of the strategy under strong selection and weak selection is obtained. The research shows that external stochastic factors, the number and scale of enterprises, the intensity of capacity replacement and the cost-benefit of intelligent construction are the main factors affecting the intelligent construction behavior of coal mining enterprises. When the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises is in the cultivation period, the intelligent construction of underground coal mines dominated by stochastic factors can be effectively promoted by increasing the intensity of capacity reduction replacement. For the open-pit coal mine dominated by expected payoffs, reducing the number of mining rights and improving the concentration of open-pit coal mining industry will have a better effect on promoting its intelligent cultivation process. When the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises is in the mature stage, with the improvement of the cost and benefits of intelligent construction, """"intelligent construction"""" strategy will become a general consensus of coal mining enterprises. In addition, this paper analyzes the relevant parameters through specific examples to verify the effectiveness of the conclusions, which provides a scientific basis for effectively accelerating the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises and promoting the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry."",,""Xue Yang was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573086], The Education Department of Henan Province [01].

The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology that enables reflective radio transmission conditions for next-generation 5G/6G wireless frameworks by intelligently adjusting the beam in the desired direction using low-cost inactive reflecting elements. In this paper, we proposed an RIS-assisted FSO system for mitigating the effects of atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, and communication system signal blockage. The probability density function and cumulative distribution functions of an FSO system composed of N-RIS elements are evaluated in a free-space environment that contains obstructions. We derived closed-form expressions for the proposed system's bit error rate (BER), outage probability, and channel capacity. The proposed system's performance is analyzed in terms of BER, outage probability, and channel capacity under various weather conditions, pointing errors, and signal blockage. The results are plotted as a function of number of RIS elements and average signal-to-noise ratio.

The UAVs' dependence on battery power represents a key limitation for practical deployment. As every remote pilot understands, even a modest research payload can limit a UAV's endurance to under 20 min. When horizontal maneuverability is not required, a power tether from the ground can provide near infinite flight time. Commercial tethers exist but can be prohibitively expensive or underpowered for research payloads. This paper describes the detailed design, construction, and operation of a relatively inexpensive open-source alternative. The designed and prototyped tether system delivers 1 kW of power at the tether base which, on an efficient UAV, corresponds to a payload of approximately 4.75 kg. We discuss the tradeoffs, design choices, best practices, and customization options, and provide empirical data for characterizing the power-payload relationship. The power and payload are scalable thanks to the modular design and the tools presented in this paper. The very low cost compared to commercial heavy-lift tether systems and the open-source design enable reproducibility and widespread use for supporting research, development, and emerging services/applications."",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

To support advanced services for UAVs such as video monitoring, one of the prospective options is to utilize recently standardized New Radio (NR) technology operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. However, blockage of propagation paths between NR base stations (BS) and UAV by buildings may lead to frequent outage situations. In our study, we use the tools of integral geometry to characterize connectivity properties of UAVs in terrestrial urban deployments of mmWave NR systems using UAV line-of-sight (LoS) blockage probability as the main metric of interest. As opposed to other studies, the use of the proposed approach allows us to get closed-form approximation for LoS blockage probability as a function of city and network deployment parameters. As one of the options to improve connectivity we also consider rooftop-mounted mmWave BSs. Our results illustrate that the proposed model provides an upper bound on UAV LoS blockage probability, and this bound becomes more accurate as the density of mmWave BS in the area increases. The closed-form structure allows for identifying of the street width, building block and BS heights, and UAV altitude as the parameters providing the most impact on the considered metric. We show that rooftop-mounted mmWave BSs allow for the drastic improvement of LoS blockage probability, i.e., depending on the system parameters the use of one rooftop-mounted mmWave BS is equivalent to 6-12 ground-mounted mmWave BSs. Out of all considered deployment parameters the street width is the one most heavily affecting the UAV LoS blockage probability. Specifically, the deployment with street width of 20 m is characterized by 50% lower UAV LoS blockage probability as compared to the one with 10 m street width."",,""Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5 were written by Vyacheslav Begishev under the support of the Russian Science Foundation, project no. 21-79-10139.

Since people spend more than 70% of their daily time in indoor environments, including home, office, and car, the efforts devoted to indoor RF-EMF exposure assessment has also increased. However, assessment of indoor exposure to RF-EMF using a deterministic approach is challenging and time consuming task as it is affected by uncertainties due to the complexity of the indoor environment and furniture structure, existence of multiple reflection, refraction, diffraction and scattering, temporal variability of exposure, and existence of many obstructions with unknown dielectric properties. Moreover, it is also affected by the existence of uncontrolled factors that can influence the indoor RF-EMF exposure such as the constant movement of people and random movement of furniture and doors as people are working in the building. In this study, a statistical approach is utilized to characterize and model the total indoor RF-EMF down-link (DL) exposure from all cellular bands on each floor over the length of a wing since the significance of distance is very low between any two points on each floor in a wing and the variation of RF-EMF DL exposure is mainly influenced by the local indoor environment. Measurements were conducted in three buildings that are located within a few hundred meters vicinity of two base station sites supporting several cellular technologies (2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G). We apply the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the measurement data, and we prove that the indoor RF-EMF DL exposure on each floor over the length of a wing is a random process governed by a Gaussian distribution. We validate this proposition using leave-one-out cross validation technique. Consequently, we conclude that the indoor RF-EMF DL exposure on each floor over the length of a wing can be modeled by a Gaussian distribution and, therefore, can be characterized by the mean and the standard deviation parameters."",The authors would like to acknowledge ATOS and in particular Quintin and Duluc that have allowed the measurements in the ATOS facilities.,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,,Humans"; Electromagnetic Fields; Environmental Exposure; Cell Phone; Radio Waves,2023-03-29,2023,2023-03-29,,23,7,3583,All OA;" Gold,Article,""Mulugeta, Biruk Ashenafi"; Wang, Shanshan; Ben Chikha, Wassim; Liu, Jiang; Roblin, Christophe;" Wiart, Joe"",""Mulugeta, Biruk Ashenafi (Chaire C2M, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France.)"; Wang, Shanshan (Chaire C2M, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France.); Ben Chikha, Wassim (Chaire C2M, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France.); Liu, Jiang (Chaire C2M, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France.); Roblin, Christophe (Chaire C2M, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France.);" Wiart, Joe (Chaire C2M, LTCI, Telecom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France.)"",""Wang, Shanshan (Institut Polytechnique de Paris)"",""Mulugeta, Biruk Ashenafi (Institut Polytechnique de Paris)"; Wang, Shanshan (Institut Polytechnique de Paris); Ben Chikha, Wassim (Institut Polytechnique de Paris); Liu, Jiang (Institut Polytechnique de Paris); Roblin, Christophe (Institut Polytechnique de Paris);" Wiart, Joe (Institut Polytechnique de Paris)"",8,8,2.99,6.91,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/7/3583/pdf?version=1680180511,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156685703,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The framework utilizes a multi-access edge computing technology such that end-user can access available resources as well the CNN on the cloud. Early detection of COVID-19 can improve treatment and mitigate transmission. During peaks of infection, hospitals worldwide have suffered from heavy patient loads, bed shortages, inadequate testing kits and short-staffing problems. Due to the time-consuming nature of the standard RT-PCR test, the lack of expert radiologists, and evaluation issues relating to poor quality images, patients with severe conditions are sometimes unable to receive timely treatment. It is thus recommended to incorporate computational intelligence methodologies, which provides highly accurate detection in a matter of minutes, alongside traditional testing as an emergency measure. CNN has achieved extraordinary performance in numerous computational intelligence tasks. However, finding a systematic, automatic and optimal set of hyperparameters for building an efficient CNN for complex tasks remains challenging. Moreover, due to advancement of technology, data are collected at sparse location and hence accumulation of data from such a diverse sparse location poses a challenge. In this article, we propose a framework of computational intelligence-based algorithm that utilize the recent 5G mobile technology of multi-access edge computing along with a new CNN-model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images. This algorithm suggests that anyone having a 5G device (e.g., 5G mobile phone) should be able to use the CNN-based automatic COVID-19 detection tool. As part of the proposed automated model, the model introduces a novel CNN structure with the genetic algorithm (GA) for hyperparameter tuning. One such combination of GA and CNN is new in the application of COVID-19 detection/classification. The experimental results show that the developed framework could classify COVID-19 X-ray images with 98.48% accuracy which is higher than any of the performances achieved by other studies."",""This work was supported by King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through Researchers Supporting Project number RSP-2021/18 and MEIF-SCI FY2021 grant of University of Maine System (UMS), USA."",,The Journal of Supercomputing,,,,2022-01-21,2022,2022-01-21,2022-05,78,7,10250-10274,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Hassan, Md Rafiul"; Ismail, Walaa N.; Chowdhury, Ahmad; Hossain, Sharara; Huda, Shamsul;" Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi"",""Hassan, Md Rafiul (College of Arts and Sciences, University of Maine at Presque Isle, ME04769, Presque Isle, USA)"; Ismail, Walaa N.

Unfortunately, the weak combination of neighboring ANFs limits the mechanical properties of ANF-based materials owing to their inherent rigidity and chemical inertness. Herein, high-performance nanopapers are fabricated by introducing a tiny amount of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to serve as reinforcing blocks via vacuum filtration. As a result of the formation of nanosized building blocks and hydrogen-bonding interaction of CNFs, the resultant ANF/CNF nanopaper yields a record-high tensile strength (406.43 ± 16.93 MPa) and toughness (86.13 ± 5.22 MJ m-3), which are 1.8 and 4.3 times higher than those of the pure ANF nanopaper, respectively. When normalized by weight, the specific tensile strength of the nanopaper is as high as 307.90 MPa·g-1·cm3, which is even significantly superior to that of titanium alloys (257 MPa·g-1·cm3). The ANF/CNF nanopaper also possesses excellent dielectric strength (53.42 kV mm-1), superior UV-shielding performance (≥99.999% absorption for ultraviolet radiation), and a favorable thermostability (Tonset = 530 °C).

This system uses charts for data visualization and flask framework for background construction, and the data is stored through CSV files, My SQL, and configuration files. The system is based on a deep learning algorithm for job applicant matching, intelligent recommendation of jobs for job seekers, and more real help for job applicants to apply for jobs. The job intelligent recommendation algorithm partly adopts bidirectional long and short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM) and the word-level human post-matching neural network APJFNN built by the attention mechanism. By embedding the text representation of job demand information into the representation vector of public space, a joint embedded convolutional neural network (JE-CNN) for post matching analysis is designed and implemented.

Therefore, other radio-communication technologies need to be adopted as a supplement, among which the mmWave communication system is a promising technology, especially for large bandwidth communication between train and trackside. However, there is a lack of evaluation of the 28 GHz mmWave channel characteristics for the railway marshaling yard scenario. In this paper, the railway marshaling yard mmWave propagation scenario is deeply analyzed and classified into three typical categories, based on which, a measurement campaign is conducted using an SDR channel sounding system equipped with a 28 GHz mmWave phased-array antenna. A self-developed software under the LabVIEW platform is used to derive the channel parameters. Conclusions on the relationship between the parameters of MPC numbers, time-spread, and received power and position, as well as the impact of typical obstructions such as the Catenary, adjacent locomotives, and buildings are drawn. The statistical results and conclusions of this paper are helpful for facilitating the design and performance evaluation of future mmWave communication systems for railway marshaling yards and can also be further extended and applied to the research of mmWave utilization in 6G and other future communication technologies for more scenarios."",""This research was supported by Liu Liang from Beijing Zengyi Technology Company, in terms of validation of the SDR measurement system."",""This research was funded by the Science and Technology R&D Program of China State Railway Group Co., Ltd., grant number SY2021G001, and the Science and Technology R&D Program of China Academy of Railway Sciences Co., Ltd., grant number of 2022YJ033."",Sensors,,,,2023-09-27,2023,2023-09-27,,23,19,8108,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Liang, Yiqun"; Li, Hui; Tian, Yuan; Li, Yi;" Wang, Wenhua"",""Liang, Yiqun (Postgraduate Department, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing 100081, China";, liangyiqun@139.com; Signal and Communication Research Institute, China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, ty1024@rails.cn, (Y.T.);; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Li, Hui (Signal and Communication Research Institute, China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, ty1024@rails.cn, (Y.T.);; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Tian, Yuan (Signal and Communication Research Institute, China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, ty1024@rails.cn, (Y.T.);; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Li, Yi (Signal and Communication Research Institute, China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, ty1024@rails.cn, (Y.T.);; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Wang, Wenhua (National Railway Track Test Center, Beijing 100015, China;", wangwenhua02@163.com)"",""Li, Hui (China Academy of Railway Sciences";" National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China)"",""Liang, Yiqun (China Academy of Railway Sciences"; China Academy of Railway Sciences; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Li, Hui (China Academy of Railway Sciences; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Tian, Yuan (China Academy of Railway Sciences; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Li, Yi (China Academy of Railway Sciences; National Research Center of Railway Intelligence Transportation System Engineering Technology, Beijing 100081, China); Wang, Wenhua (National Railway Track Test Center, Beijing 100015, China;", wangwenhua02@163.com)"",0,0,,2.39,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/19/8108/pdf?version=1695807216,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164514831,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

WSNs are widely used in industrial applications, precision agriculture and animal tracking systems, environment monitoring, smart grids, energy control systems, smart buildings and entertainment industry etc. The distributed and dynamic scheme of WSNs establishes very unique demands in developing clustering and routing protocols. In order to meet the demand of efficient WSNs, most important requirement is energy management and extension of network lifetime. So energy constraints issue is one of the most emerging area for research to reduce the complexity of network functioning. Due to the complexity of this task we need more robustness optimizer algorithms which can tackle these types of tasks. In this article we are trying to develop one improved version of chimp optimizer for energy constraint issues. In this modification have been integrated the chimp optimizer with dimension learning based hunting (DLH) search technique, known as Improved Chimp Optimizer Algorithm (IChoA). Here the DLH search strategy helps in maintaining diversity and improves the balance between exploitation and exploration. To compute the robustness in solving the optimizer issues, IChoA has been tested on 29-CEC-2017 test suites and energy constraint issues. Experimental solutions obtained by proposed methods are verified with recent methods. All simulation shows that the IChoA method can be most effective in solving the standard complex suites and energy constraint issues."",""This work is an outcome of research supported by the Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme for Electronics &amp";" IT, MEITY.

The steel industry is a necessary support for modern life and economic development, and the Chinese steel industry's capacity has expanded to roughly half of global production. However, the Chinese steel industry is now confronted with high labor costs, massive carbon emissions, a low level of intelligence, low production efficiency, and unstable quality control. Therefore, China's steel industry has launched several large-scale intelligent manufacturing initiatives to improve production efficiency, product quality, manual labor intensity, and employee working conditions. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive overview of intelligent manufacturing in China's steel industry. We began this research by summarizing the construction goals and overall framework for intelligent manufacturing of the steel industry in China. Following that, we offered a brief review of intelligent manufacturing for China's steel industry, as well as descriptions of two typical intelligent manufacturing models. Finally, some major technologies employed for intelligent production in China's steel industry were introduced. This research not only helps to comprehend the development model, essential technologies, and construction techniques of intelligent manufacturing in China's steel industry, but it also provides vital inspiration for the manufacturing industry's digital and intelligence updates and quality improvement."",,This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFB3202400 & 2021YFB3202403) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (51874022).,Sensors,,""Nabil Anwer, Feng Gao, Yanlong Cao"",Steel"; Industry; Commerce; Quality Control; Intelligence; China,2022-10-26,2022,2022-10-26,,22,21,8194,All OA;" Gold,Article,""Zhou, Dongdong"; Xu, Ke; Lv, Zhimin; Yang, Jianhong; Li, Min; He, Fei;" Xu, Gang"",""Zhou, Dongdong (Collaborative Innovation Center of Steel Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China"; Yangjiang Alloy Material Laboratory, 1 Luoqin Road, Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang 529500, China); Xu, Ke (Collaborative Innovation Center of Steel Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China; Yangjiang Alloy Material Laboratory, 1 Luoqin Road, Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang 529500, China); Lv, Zhimin (Collaborative Innovation Center of Steel Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China); Yang, Jianhong (School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China); Li, Min (Collaborative Innovation Center of Steel Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China); He, Fei (Collaborative Innovation Center of Steel Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China);" Xu, Gang (Collaborative Innovation Center of Steel Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, 30 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China)"",""Xu, Ke (University of Science and Technology Beijing";" Yangjiang Alloy Material Laboratory, 1 Luoqin Road, Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang 529500, China)"",""Zhou, Dongdong (University of Science and Technology Beijing"; Yangjiang Alloy Material Laboratory, 1 Luoqin Road, Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang 529500, China); Xu, Ke (University of Science and Technology Beijing; Yangjiang Alloy Material Laboratory, 1 Luoqin Road, Jiangcheng District, Yangjiang 529500, China); Lv, Zhimin (University of Science and Technology Beijing); Yang, Jianhong (University of Science and Technology Beijing); Li, Min (University of Science and Technology Beijing); He, Fei (University of Science and Technology Beijing);" Xu, Gang (University of Science and Technology Beijing)"",37,36,1.87,13.29,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8194/pdf?version=1666774167,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152249997,40 Engineering";" 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, conventional cantilever-based designs of MEMS switches require a large actuation voltage, exhibit limited RF performance, and suffer from many performance tradeoffs due to their flat geometries restricted in two dimensions (2D). Here, by leveraging the residual stress in thin films, we report a novel development of three-dimensional (3D) wavy microstructures, which offer the potential to serve as high-performance RF switches. Relying on standard IC-compatible metallic materials, we devise a simple fabrication process to repeatedly manufacture out-of-plane wavy beams with controllable bending profiles and yields reaching 100%. We then demonstrate the utility of such metallic wavy beams as RF switches achieving both extremely low actuation voltage and improved RF performance owing to their unique geometry, which is tunable in three dimensions and exceeds the capabilities of current state-of-the-art flat-cantilever switches with 2D-restricted topology. As such, the wavy cantilever switch presented in this work actuates at voltages as low as 24 V while simultaneously exhibiting RF isolation and insertion loss of 20 dB and 0.75 dB, respectively, for frequencies up to 40 GHz. Wavy switch designs with 3D geometries break through the design limits set by traditional flat cantilevers and provide an additional degree of freedom or control knob in the switch design process, which could enable further optimization of switching networks used in current 5G and upcoming 6G communication scenarios."",""This work was supported in part by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) grant number 118E842, the Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA) Outstanding Young Scientist Award (TUBA-GEBIP) to Murat Kaya Yapici, and Sabanci University.

The research is aimed at studying the energy conservation data and information model of large public buildings. Based on the theories of 5G technology, embedded system, and energy conservation of large public buildings, firstly, 5G technology is used to collect research data. Secondly, some large public buildings in Northwest China are analyzed for energy conservation by using ZigBee and other related technologies and algorithms. Finally, the office buildings in large public buildings are used as samples for the construction of the information model to be analyzed. The research results denote that large public buildings are mainly concentrated in hospitals, hotels, shopping malls, and so on. The south-facing window to wall ratio is higher than that of the north-facing window to wall ratio, and the east-west-facing window to wall ratio has the lowest probability of appearing. In addition, the thermal conductivity of the roof of most of the large buildings is less than 1.0 W, while the thermal conductivity of the outer wall of the roof is distributed around 2.5 W, and the thermal conductivity of the outer wall is around 0.6 W. Finally, commercial buildings have higher heating and cooling loads than residential buildings. In the construction of the information model for energy conservation of large public buildings, the neural networks (NNs) and clustering analysis algorithm are introduced into the prediction model of energy consumption data, and it is found that compared with the actual observed value, the overall trend shows consistency, both of which are periodic fluctuations. However, there are still some errors in some data. Therefore, an analysis of energy conservation data of embedded large public buildings and the construction of information models based on 5G has important guiding significance for the construction industry to improve business performance and market competitiveness."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.,,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,,Haibin Lv,,2022-05-09,2022,2022-05-09,2022-05-09,2022,1,1-12,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Zhao, Xing";" Yan, Zengfeng"",""Zhao, Xing (College of Architecture, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an City 710055, China xauat.edu.cn)";" Yan, Zengfeng (College of Architecture, Xi’an University of Architecture and Technology, Xi’an City 710055, China xauat.edu.cn)"",""Zhao, Xing (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)"",""Zhao, Xing (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)";" Yan, Zengfeng (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)"",4,4,,1.76,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2022/3023323.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147745059,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A novel service-oriented cloud manufacturing (CMfg) model could in theory increase utilization and profitability of distributed production facilities. However, little research has investigated how IC can benefit from the CMfg model. This paper examines opportunities and challenges of applying CMfg for IC. First, an adapted model of CMfg for construction is developed based on a literature review. Second, four possible scenarios for applying this adapted CMfg model are designed. Finally, an evaluation is performed through a survey among 25 practitioners and 12 in-depth interviews with industry experts. The paper assesses the desirability and categorizes the benefits and barriers of such a CMfg platform for IC. The results suggest that CMfg could enhance the design quality, support IC suitability assessment for project developers and lower financial risks for off-site manufacturers."",The authors would like to thank the survey participants and interview partners for their valuable input and time.

However, little efforts have been done so far on the exposure assessment from 5G cellular towers over young people and “sensitive” buildings, like schools and medical centers. To face such issues, we provide a sound methodology for the numerical evaluation of 5G (and pre-5G) downlink exposure over children, teenagers, schools and medical centers. We then apply the proposed methodology over two real scenarios. Results reveal that the exposure from 5G cellular towers will increase in the forthcoming years, in parallel with the growth of the 5G adoption levels. However, the exposure levels are well below the maximum ones defined by international regulations. Moreover, the exposure over children and teenagers is similar to the one of the whole population, while the exposure over schools and medical centers can be lower than the one of the whole set of buildings. Finally, the exposure from 5G is strongly lower than the pre-5G one when the building attenuation is introduced and a maturity adoption level for 5G is assumed."",,This work was supported by the PLAN-EMF Project (KAUST-CNIT) under Award OSR-2020-CRG9-4377.,IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-09-23,2022-01-01,3,,1592-1614,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Chiaraviglio, Luca"; Lodovisi, Chiara; Franci, Daniele; Grillo, Enrico; Pavoncello, Settimio; Aureli, Tommaso; Blefari-Melazzi, Nicola;" Alouini, Mohamed-Slim"",""Chiaraviglio, Luca (Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy"; Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, 43124, Parma, Italy); Lodovisi, Chiara (Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy; Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, 43124, Parma, Italy); Franci, Daniele (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Grillo, Enrico (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Pavoncello, Settimio (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Aureli, Tommaso (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Blefari-Melazzi, Nicola (Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy; Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, 43124, Parma, Italy);" Alouini, Mohamed-Slim (Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, 6900, Makkah, Saudi Arabia)"",""Chiaraviglio, Luca (University of Rome Tor Vergata";" Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni)"",""Chiaraviglio, Luca (University of Rome Tor Vergata"; Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni); Lodovisi, Chiara (University of Rome Tor Vergata; Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni); Franci, Daniele (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Grillo, Enrico (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Pavoncello, Settimio (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Aureli, Tommaso (Agenzia per la Protezione Ambientale del Lazio (ARPA Lazio), 00173, Rome, Italy); Blefari-Melazzi, Nicola (University of Rome Tor Vergata; Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni);" Alouini, Mohamed-Slim (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology)"",7,7,,3.64,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8782661/8901158/09900418.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151274254,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the opening of GNSS raw observation data, research on the positioning of a 5G smart communication base station has become a research hotspot in the surveying and mapping disciplines. In this paper, based on the GNSS observation data of the 5G smart communication base station, the quality of the original GNSS observation data of the 5G smart communication base station is studied and analyzed. A method based on Doppler smoothing pseudorange solves the problem that the original pseudorange observation values of the 5G smart communication base station are noisy and prone to multipath errors due to the limitations of the base station chips and processes, which makes the traditional data processing methods unable to meet the demand for higher accuracy positioning. This method uses Doppler observations to smooth the pseudorange and determines the Doppler smoothing strategy and closure values to improve the data quality. The experimental data show that Doppler smoothing pseudorange can improve data quality and positioning accuracy by 67.9% in the E direction, 64.8% in the N direction, and 65.5% in the U direction. The future world will develop in the direction of intelligence, and the wireless network 5G technology used to support the construction of this intelligent system will become the core driver for the development of a leading intelligent society. 5G network signals have higher reliability and lower latency and can meet the specific needs of smart manufacturing, autonomous driving, and other industrial applications. This new base station product can meet the construction needs of future 5G base stations, adapt to the future intensive, miniaturized, intelligent station construction mode, and realize safe and fast station construction, providing the necessary hardware support for 5G network coverage."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

This opened the door for novel extended reality (XR) media applications to emerge with 5G. However, recent 5G field tests and system-level simulation studies show that further XR enhancements are required to support a massive adoption of XR services in 5G networks. Such enhancements are expected to come into play with 5G-Advanced. In this line, we propose and study an XR loopback mechanism that adapts the XR traffic to the instantaneous 5G network conditions by exploiting an XR application feedback. We propose various XR loopback algorithms, strategies, and parameters’ configurations and study their impact on the 5G end-to-end performance. We conduct extensive simulation campaigns by building realistic end-to-end 5G network scenarios with 3GPP mixed XR traffic setups. Results show that the proposed XR loopback mechanism can boost XR performance in 5G networks by adapting to 5G network conditions, while keeping the XR QoS requirements under control.

The slicing strategy can greatly increase the connections of base station clients and the utilization of network resources, and effectively reduce block radio and handover radio.

Among others uses, channel characterization and modeling can be used for coverage and performance analysis and prediction. Within this context, this paper describes a comprehensive dataset of channel measurements performed to analyze outdoor-to-indoor propagation characteristics in the mid-band spectrum identified for the operation of 5th Generation (5G) cellular systems. Previous efforts to analyze outdoor-to-indoor propagation characteristics in this band were made by using measurements collected on dedicated, mostly single-link setups. Hence, measurements performed on deployed and operational 5G networks still lack in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dataset of measurements performed over commercial 5G networks. In particular, the dataset includes measurements of channel power delay profiles from two 5G networks in Band n78, i.e., 3.3–3.8 GHz. Such measurements were collected at multiple locations in a large office building in the city of Rome, Italy by using the Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) TSMA6 network scanner during several weeks in 2020 and 2021.

The e-commerce model, that is, e-commerce transactions across international trade, has been rapidly expanded. However, e-commerce transactions across international trade have innate virtuality and information imbalance. These problems have caused many credibility problems and, at the same time, restrict and hinder the healthy and sustainable evolution of transactions across international trade. Credit evaluation of transaction entities through credit evaluation models is an effective way to restrict the behavior of transaction entities. However, the existing credit evaluation models lack pertinence and effectiveness when applied in the context of cross-border e-commerce. In the era of 5G communication, building a complete credit evaluation system through 5G-related technologies will certainly become a new way for the stable evolution of transactions across international trade. This not only can effectively control the risks of cross-border trade and improve efficiency but also properly resolve the uncertainty caused by information imbalance. In order to better promote the development of e-commerce, this article establishes an e-business evaluation module based on integrated fusion performance rating. The weight and the membership of each factor are determined by AHP. Finally, the model was verified by an example. The results show that the evaluation system and the method proposed in this paper are feasible and effective for solving practical problems and provide a solid foundation for the construction of the network of my country’s e-commerce credit rating system.

The various types of environmental sensors are very diverse. Wireless sensing networks may include many different types of sensing devices or data related to images or pattern transmission, among others, and are often limited by the problem of insufficient network bandwidth. By using 5G communications for data transmission, the problem of limited network bandwidth can be solved. In addition to the use of 5G transmission, when the NB-IoT method is used within the 5G network environment, it is much more efficient than that under the original LTE network conditions. Therefore, using 5G to transmit data provides the advantages of high transmission efficiency and data integrity. In this paper, in addition to analyzing the development of 5G technology, the proposed approach uses MATLAB software to simulate the generation of 5G signals under various parameter settings representing a range of conditions. Finally, our approach discusses the use of a 5G communication module, including driver installation and data transmission testing. At present, the 5G network architecture is still under construction worldwide. According to the transmission speed test data obtained in this study, the transmission efficiency of 5G is better than that of precursor generations."",""This research was supported by the Department of Information Technology, Takming University of Science and Technology.

We focused on the intelligent development of coal mines, and introduced the “Chinese mode” of intelligent mining in underground coal mines, which uses complete sets of technical equipment to propose classification and grading standards. In view of the basic characteristics and technical requirements of intelligent coal mine systems, we established a digital logic model and propose an information entity and knowledge map construction method. This involves an active information push strategy based on a knowledge demand model and an intelligent portfolio modeling and distribution method for collaborative control of coal mines. The top-level architecture of 5G+ intelligent coal mine systems combines intelligent applications such as autonomous intelligent mining, human–machine collaborative rapid tunneling, unmanned auxiliary transportation, closed-loop safety control, lean collaborative operation, and intelligent ecology. Progress in intelligent mining technology was described in terms of a dynamic modified geological model, underground 5G network and positioning technology, intelligent control of the mining height and straightness of the longwall working face, and intelligent mining equipment. The development of intelligent coal mines was analyzed in terms of its imbalances, bottlenecks, and the compatibility of large-scale systems. Implementation ideas for promoting the development of intelligent coal mines were proposed, such as establishing construction standards and technical specifications, implementing classification and grading standards according to mining policy, accelerating key technology research, and building a new management and control model."",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Numbers 51834006 and 51874174).,,International Journal of Coal Science & Technology,,,,2022-04-15,2022,2022-04-15,2022-12,9,1,24,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Wang, Guofa"; Ren, Huaiwei; Zhao, Guorui; Zhang, Desheng; Wen, Zhiguo; Meng, Lingyu;" Gong, Shixin"",""Wang, Guofa (Coal Mining and Designing Department, Tiandi Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 100013, Beijing, China"; CCTEG Coal Mining Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100013, Beijing, China; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp, 100013, Beijing, China; Mining Design Institute, China Coal Research Institute, 100013, Beijing, China); Ren, Huaiwei (Coal Mining and Designing Department, Tiandi Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 100013, Beijing, China; CCTEG Coal Mining Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100013, Beijing, China; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp, 100013, Beijing, China; Mining Design Institute, China Coal Research Institute, 100013, Beijing, China); Zhao, Guorui (Coal Mining and Designing Department, Tiandi Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 100013, Beijing, China; CCTEG Coal Mining Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100013, Beijing, China; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp, 100013, Beijing, China; Mining Design Institute, China Coal Research Institute, 100013, Beijing, China); Zhang, Desheng (Coal Mining and Designing Department, Tiandi Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 100013, Beijing, China; CCTEG Coal Mining Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100013, Beijing, China; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp, 100013, Beijing, China; Mining Design Institute, China Coal Research Institute, 100013, Beijing, China); Wen, Zhiguo (Coal Mining and Designing Department, Tiandi Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 100013, Beijing, China; CCTEG Coal Mining Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100013, Beijing, China; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp, 100013, Beijing, China; Mining Design Institute, China Coal Research Institute, 100013, Beijing, China); Meng, Lingyu (Beijing Tianma Intelligent Control Technology Co., Ltd., 101320, Beijing, China); Gong, Shixin (Coal Mining and Designing Department, Tiandi Science and Technology Co., Ltd, 100013, Beijing, China; CCTEG Coal Mining Research Institute Co., Ltd., 100013, Beijing, China; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp, 100013, Beijing, China;" Mining Design Institute, China Coal Research Institute, 100013, Beijing, China)"",""Ren, Huaiwei (Tiandi Science & Technology (China)"; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China);" China Coal Research Institute (China))"",""Wang, Guofa (Tiandi Science & Technology (China)"; China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Research Institute (China)); Ren, Huaiwei (Tiandi Science & Technology (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Research Institute (China)); Zhao, Guorui (Tiandi Science & Technology (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Research Institute (China)); Zhang, Desheng (Tiandi Science & Technology (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Research Institute (China)); Wen, Zhiguo (Tiandi Science & Technology (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Research Institute (China)); Meng, Lingyu (Beijing Tianma Intelligent Control Technology Co., Ltd., 101320, Beijing, China); Gong, Shixin (Tiandi Science & Technology (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China); China Coal Technology and Engineering Group Corp (China);" China Coal Research Institute (China))"",74,63,,21.59,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40789-022-00491-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147147625,40 Engineering"; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The fifth generation of cellular mobile communications (5G) will cover this need as one of three key capacities in their usage scenarios: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). The 5G systems are composed of mobile devices and various internet of things (IoT) devices for sensing, acting, and information services";" they configure diverse networking topologies such as direct mobile-to-mobile, also known as device-to-device (D2D). In the 5G D2D network systems, the network topologies are easily broken because of the mobile devices such as smartphones, IoT devices, and so on. Thus, for the highly flexible and extensible 5G D2D network systems, mobility support for the mobile devices is necessary. In this paper, we first explore the mobility issues in beyond 5G D2D. Since there are static and mobile elements in the 5G application domains such as the smart factory, overall mobility would lead to highly frequent topology reconfiguration or connectivity reconstruction. Thus, latency-related problems derived from topology changes and connectivity failures due to the mobility are addressed. To handle the problems, a fast connectivity construction scheme, denoted by LMK, is proposed with a deep neural network dealing with learning on radio signal information in order to achieve the LLC. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can provide reliable connectivity for the MAC layer link with a low latency data transmission."",,This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2022-05-16,2022,2022-05-16,,11,10,1580,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Lee, Sang-Hoon"; Seo, Sangwon; Park, Soochang;" Kim, Tae-Sung"",""Lee, Sang-Hoon (Department of Management Information Systems, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea";, sanghoon@chungbuk.ac.kr, (S.-H.L.);, kimts@chungbuk.ac.kr, (T.-S.K.)); Seo, Sangwon (School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea;, sw_seo@korea.ac.kr); Park, Soochang (Department of Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea); Kim, Tae-Sung (Department of Management Information Systems, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea;, sanghoon@chungbuk.ac.kr, (S.-H.L.);", kimts@chungbuk.ac.kr, (T.-S.K.))"",""Park, Soochang (Chungbuk National University)"",""Lee, Sang-Hoon (Chungbuk National University)"; Seo, Sangwon (Korea University); Park, Soochang (Chungbuk National University);" Kim, Tae-Sung (Chungbuk National University)"",1,1,,0.52,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/10/1580/pdf?version=1652673059,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147921392,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By integrating the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and 5G systems, more reliable positioning services can be provided, and BDS–5G signal integrated positioning has become a new research hotspot. However, BDS–5G signal fusion positioning faces the problems of how to build an effective fusion positioning model between heterogeneous systems and the high complexity of multiobjective function positioning solutions. Therefore, this paper constructs a TOA/TDOA fusion positioning model of BDS–5G signals and introduces the multiobjective particle swarm optimization positioning solution method (MOPSO) to realize the reliable positioning of BDS and 5G signal system fusion (MOPSO-TOA/TDOA). The experimental results show that compared with the traditional BDS–5G signal fusion positioning algorithm based on a Kalman filter, the positioning accuracy of the BDS–5G signal joint solution system based on a multiobjective particle fusion algorithm is 24.8% higher than that of the Kalman filter in terms of positioning convergence time, 18.9% higher in terms of system positioning accuracy, and 50–80% higher than that of the BDS positioning system alone, and the reliable positioning ability in complex environments is effectively enhanced."",,This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFB3904702) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (6220020330).,Applied Sciences,,,,2022-12-27,2022,2022-12-27,,13,1,366,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Lu, Jun"; Ding, Wuyi; Wang, Wei; Hu, Enwen;" Wu, Jianfeng"",""Lu, Jun (Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, Beijing 100049, China)"; Ding, Wuyi (School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China); Wang, Wei (Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, Beijing 100049, China); Hu, Enwen (School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China); Wu, Jianfeng (National Time Service Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi’an 710600, China;" School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China)"",""Hu, Enwen (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Lu, Jun (Chinese People's Liberation Army)"; Ding, Wuyi (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Wang, Wei (Chinese People's Liberation Army); Hu, Enwen (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Wu, Jianfeng (National Time Service Center;" University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)"",0,0,,1.7,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/1/366/pdf?version=1672897536,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154045919,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By utilizing the Literature- Delphi method, 27 risk indicators are identified and categorized into four aspects: Technical Risk (B1, weight: 0.09576), Environmental Risk (B2, weight: 0.19957), Economic and Management Risk (B3, weight: 0.32437), and Planning Risk (B4, weight: 0.3803). This indicates that the major risks in the case region are primarily associated with the economic and planning aspects, while the technical aspect has reached a mature level. Based on the evaluation results, the overall risk level of the wireless equipment project is determined to be at Level II. Subsequently, risk mitigation measures were implemented based on the risk evaluation outcomes. It is observed that the project’s risk probability score decreases to 0.127, the risk loss score reduces to 0.257, and the risk level is lowered to Level I after the implementation of control measures. The findings of this study contribute to enhancing the profitability and value of mobile communication construction projects, while effectively minimizing additional costs."",,This work was supported by the following projects: 1) Project approval support from Provincial Curriculum Ideological and Political Teaching Project of Zhejiang Education Department in 2022 (Teaching Research Project): “Research on the Design and Practice Path of Vocational Platform Course ‘Curriculum Ideological and Political’ under the background of New Business Science”. 2) Project approval support from Outstanding Scientific Research Team Project of Zhejiang Technical Institute of Economics in 2021: “Research Team on Internal Control Mechanism of Private Enterprises under the Background of High-quality Development of Common Prosperity Demonstration Zone”. 3) Project approval support from Zhejiang Province Association of Higher Education in 2023: “A Study on the Visual and Accurate Evaluation of Academic Ability of Vocational College Students Driven by Data”.,Wireless Networks,,,,2023-10-17,2023,2023-10-17,2024-11,30,8,6821-6832,Closed,Article,""Yu, Qianqian"; Fu, Yan-Kai; Zhang, Jiawei;" Huang, Xiang"",""Yu, Qianqian (College of Accounting and Finance, Zhejiang Technical Institute of Economics, Hangzhou, China)"; Fu, Yan-Kai (Department of Aviation Services and Management, China University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan); Zhang, Jiawei (Changzhou Institute of Technology, Changzhou, China);" Huang, Xiang (School of Finance and Trade, Wenzhou Business College, Wenzhou, China)"",""Huang, Xiang (School of Finance and Trade, Wenzhou Business College, Wenzhou, China)"",""Yu, Qianqian (Zhejiang Technical Institute of Economics)"; Fu, Yan-Kai (China University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Jiawei (Changzhou Institute of Technology);" Huang, Xiang (School of Finance and Trade, Wenzhou Business College, Wenzhou, China)"",1,1,,0.57,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164976304,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This letter develops a simulation-based evaluation framework and investigates the harmful interference between the 5G radio links and incumbent fixed non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) fixed satellite services (FSS) receivers of the 12 GHz band. A variety of features including actual deployment locations of 5G base stations (BSs) and fixed NGSO FSS receivers, industry-standardized beamforming at BSs, directional signal reception at FSS receivers, realistic propagation channels with obstruction from buildings, and channel scheduling at 5G BSs are incorporated in the interference study. Simulation results conducted in a realistic urban-micro deployment scenario confirm that the terrestrial 5G networks with directional BSs can coexist in the 12GHz band by suitably selecting exclusion zone’s radius around the FSS receiver. Simulation results also show that interference in the coexisting network can be notably reduced by appropriately activating BSs in the 12 GHz band based on their locations and surroundings."",,This work was supported by NSF under Grant CNS-2128540 and Grant CNS-2128584.,IEEE Wireless Communications Letters,,,,2023-05-31,2023,2023-05-31,2023-09-01,12,9,1528-1532,Closed,Article,""Niloy, Ta-Seen Reaz"; Hassan, Zoheb; Stephenson, Nathan;" Shah, Vijay K."",""Niloy, Ta-Seen Reaz (NextG Wireless Lab, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, 22030, USA)"; Hassan, Zoheb (Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, 24061, USA); Stephenson, Nathan (NextG Wireless Lab, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, 22030, USA);" Shah, Vijay K.

But in this situation, the issues of network security in general and the security of the government radio communication network come to the fore. In addition, indicators of the quality of service for subscribers of government communication networks are also very important at the moment. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct a meaningful analysis of the possibilities of using modern cellular communication networks to determine the possibilities of building government radio communication networks on their basis. As a result of the work, an analysis of the main requirements for 5G cellular communication networks was carried out, in particular, regarding their reliability, data transmission speed, delay, mobility support and other characteristics important for the user, and a study of the main requirements for modern government radio communication networks was carried out. For this purpose, the classification of services, which are planned to be provided to subscribers of modern and promising government radio communication networks in Ukraine, was expanded. New requirements were formed for these new services, which include user requirements related to quality of service (user experience) and functional requirements. It was shown that, thanks to the use of the principles of Network Slicing, the physical infrastructure is divided into virtual platforms, each of which uses the resources and technologies that are best suited for solving its tasks. This makes it possible to build more secure, isolated layers of the 5G network. An improved architecture of the government radio communication network based on 5G technology was also presented. Thanks to the capabilities provided by 5G, encryption and control of the integrity of signaling and user traffic will be carried out, which is the most important thing for government radio communication networks. Also, 5G makes it possible to isolate different layers of the Network slicing architecture and define its own security levels for the government radio communication layer. A secure government communication session establishment procedure was developed for this architecture."",,,Science-based technologies,,,,2023-04-29,2023,2023-04-29,,57,1,47-57,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Odarchenko, Roman"; Hryhorenko, Dmytro; Fesenko, Vladyslav;" Drofa, Tetiana"",""Odarchenko, Roman (National aviation University, Kiev, Ukraine)"; Hryhorenko, Dmytro (State Research Institute of Cyber Security and Information Protection Technologies, Kyiv, Ukraine); Fesenko, Vladyslav (National aviation University, Kiev, Ukraine);" Drofa, Tetiana (National aviation University, Kiev, Ukraine)"",,""Odarchenko, Roman (National Aviation University)"; Hryhorenko, Dmytro (State Research Institute of Cyber Security and Information Protection Technologies, Kyiv, Ukraine); Fesenko, Vladyslav (National Aviation University);" Drofa, Tetiana (National Aviation University)"",0,0,,0.0,https://jrnl.nau.edu.ua/index.php/SBT/article/download/17444/24757,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160653479,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As the core equipment of the 5G network, 5G base stations provide wireless coverage and realize wireless signal transmission between wired communication networks and wireless terminals. However, as the scale of 5G base stations gradually increases, problems such as poor user experience and insufficient coverage area frequently occur. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the comprehensive performance of 5G base stations, so as to clarify the problems existing in the construction of base stations. First, the performance evaluation index system is constructed from the perspectives of operational performance, financial performance, environmental impact, and social influence. Then, a novel hybrid multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on the Bayesian best-worst method (BBWM) and difference-quotient gray relational analysis (DQ-GRA) technique is adopted. Finally, sixteen 5G base stations are taken as examples for analysis. The result shows that the signal coverage area and per capita input cost are the most important indicators greatly affecting the overall performance of the 5G base station. Compared with the two other MCDM models, the proposed hybrid MCDM model has good applicability and effectiveness for performance evaluation of 5G base stations."",""Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

"762,pub.1154189166,10.3390/su15010672,,,Millimetre Wave and Sub-6 5G Readiness of Mobile Network Big Data for Public Transport Planning,""The need to solve public transport planning challenges using 5G is demanding. In 2019, the world started using 5G technology. Unfortunately, many countries have no equipment that is compatible with 5G infrastructures. There are two main deployment options for countries willing to accept 5G. They can directly venture to install relatively expensive infrastructure, called 5G SA (standalone access). However, more countries use the 5G NSA (non-standalone access) alternative, a 5G network supported by existing 4G infrastructure. One of the considerations for choosing NSA 5G is that it still performs 4G equalisation in its area. The data throughput is faster but still uses the leading 4G network. Interestingly, there are three types of 5G: low-band (sub-6), middle-band (sub-6), and high-band (millimetre-wave (mmWave)). The problem is determining the kind of 5G needed for public transport planning. Meanwhile, mobile network big data (MNBD) requires robust and stable internet access, with broad coverage in real time. MNBD movement includes the movement of people and vehicles, as well as logistics. GPS and internet connections track the activity of private vehicles and public transportation. The difference between mmWave and sub-6 5G can complement transportation planning needs. The density and height of buildings in urban areas and the affordability of the range of the connections determine 5G. This study examines the literature on 5G and then, using the bibliographic method, matches the network coverage obtained in Indonesia using nPerf data services.

We propose the prospects on the use of composite building materials enhanced with different volumetric fractions of iron (III) oxide (Fe 2 O 3 ) inclusions as a reddish‐brown colouring admixture in modern‐day concrete. Using a non‐destructive microwave measurement technique, a two‐factor 6 × 10 factorial experiment and a randomized controlled statistical study from 3.40 to 3.60 GHz is conducted on 15‐cm thick building material prototypes enhanced with 2‐ wt % to 10‐ wt % micro‐sized Fe 2 O 3 inclusions to evaluate their efficacy on EM wave propagation. Transmission coefficients (S 21 ) data are analysed statistically between treatment and control groups, yielding up to 2.28 dB mean S 21 improvement in performance and a fractional bandwidth of 100% by the 2‐ wt % Fe 2 O 3 treatment group. Electromagnetic characterisations of the fabricated mortar samples with different Fe 2 O 3 inclusions are performed using Nicholson‐Ross‐Weir model followed by the evaluation of dielectric and propagation losses. Our findings support the use of 2‐ wt % Fe 2 O 3 as the optimal volumetric fraction which improves the microwave transparency, thus creating potential EM benefits for the fifth‐generation (5G) wireless communication systems."",""ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister&#x27";"s Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise programme.

The interference between time division duplex (TDD) 5G private networks depends on various factors, such as frequency channels, synchronization, and building entry loss (BEL). In this study, we propose separation distances at which two 5G private networks in close proximity can coexist. The amount of interference according to the separation distance between the two 5G private networks was simulated by the Monte Carlo (MC) method. When the two networks operated in an outdoor environment and had different channels, there was a minimum interference effect even if the cell radii of the two networks overlap. However, the separation distance between networks using the same channel was simulated to be approximately 500 m. The TDD synchronization of two networks using the same channel reduced the separation distance to approximately 100 m. The additional radio wave attenuation by the BEL reduced the amount of interference, allowing frequency coexistence between networks even within the cell radii."",,,Journal of Communications,,,,2023-04,2023,2023-04,,,,250-255,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Kim, Hyuk-Je";" Lee, Il-Kyoo"",""Kim, Hyuk-Je ()";" Lee, Il-Kyoo ()"",,""Kim, Hyuk-Je ()";" Lee, Il-Kyoo ()"",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.12720/jcm.18.4.250-255,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157048888,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The network coverage directly influences the quality of service (QoS) of vertical industries. Coverage capability is a crucial and indispensable indicator when evaluating the performance of a network. However, the results of the current algorithm fall short in terms of accuracy. To restore the current status of 5G network coverage more realistically, in this study, we design a new optimization algorithm for coverage calculation based on the traditional coverage algorithm combined with fourth–generation (4G) coverage reference signal receiving power (RSRP) in management report (MR) and adopt a multisystem collaborative analysis method. The algorithm corrects the coverage results and restores the true value of 5G coverage. Based on this, we provide a practical analysis of the largest standalone (SA) commercial network in the world, which confirms the viability of the algorithm. Both theoretical and practical analyses show that the algorithm can effectively detect hidden weak coverage areas, providing a further reference for future 5G construction and improving the 5G user experience.

To reduce this loss in energy-efficient buildings, a passive antenna system was developed and integrated into sandwich walls. However, the thermal effects of this system, which includes highly thermally conductive metals, require further study. In this research, three-dimensional heat transfer simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to determine the thermal transmittances (U-values) of 5G antenna walls. The results revealed that, using stainless steel as the connector material (current design), the U-value rose from 0.1496 (for the wall without antenna) to 0.156 W/m2K, leading to an additional heating loss per year of only 0.545 KWh/m2 in Helsinki. In contrast, with the previous design that used copper as the connector material, the U-value increased dramatically to 0.3 W/m2K, exceeding the National Building Code of Finland’s limit of 0.17 W/m2K and causing 12.8 KWh/m2 additional heat loss (23.5 times more than the current design). The current design significantly reduces thermal bridging effects. Additionally, three analytical methods were used to calculate antenna wall U-values: parallel paths, isothermal planes, and ISO 6946 combined. The isothermal planes method was found to be more accurate and reliable. The study also found that a wall unit cell with a single developed 5G antenna and a wall consisting of nine such cells arranged in a 3 × 3 grid pattern had the same U-values. Furthermore, areas affected by thermal bridging were typically smaller than the dimensions of a wall unit cell (150 mm × 150 mm)."",We thank Derek Clements-Croome for the editing assistance.,""This research was funded by the Academy of Finland, project STARCLUB, grant number 324023."",Energies,,,,2023-03-12,2023,2023-03-12,,16,6,2657,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Lu, Tao"; Vähä-Savo, Lauri; Lü, Xiaoshu;" Haneda, Katsuyuki"",""Lu, Tao (Department of Electrical Engineering and Energy Technology, University of Vaasa, P.O.

The energy storage of base station has the potential to promote frequency stability as the construction of the 5G base station accelerates. This paper proposes a control strategy for flexibly participating in power system frequency regulation using the energy storage of 5G base station. Firstly, the potential ability of energy storage in base station is analyzed from the structure and energy flow. Then, the framework of 5G base station participating in power system frequency regulation is constructed, and the specific steps are described. Finally, with the objective to minimize the power vacancy, the optimization model of the 5G base station auxiliary power system frequency response is established.

There has been a continuing advancement from 4G to 5G networks, with 5G mainly providing the three services of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communication (eMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency services (URLLC). Since it is difficult to provide all of these services on a physical network, the 5G network is partitioned into multiple virtual networks called “slices”. These slices customize these unique services and enable the network to be reliable and fulfill the needs of its users. This phenomenon is called network slicing. Security is a critical concern in network slicing as adversaries have evolved to become more competent and often employ new attack strategies. This study focused on the security issues that arise during the network slice lifecycle. Machine learning and deep learning algorithm solutions were applied in the planning and design, construction and deployment, monitoring, fault detection, and security phases of the slices. This paper outlines the 5G network slicing concept, its layers and architectural framework, and the prevention of attacks, threats, and issues that represent how network slicing influences the 5G network.

Aiming at the diversity and complexity of regional traffic influencing factors of road network in the construction of smart city, this research carries out resource real-time load balancing scheduling from the perspective of 5G heterogeneous network. Meanwhile, CNN (convolutional neural network) in the introduced deep learning algorithm is improved, and finally an intelligent traffic prediction model is constructed based on 5G load balancing and AlexNet network. The model is simulated and its performance is analyzed. The results show that the algorithm proposed is compared with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network), and BN (Bayesian network) models regarding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1. It is found that the road network prediction accuracy of the algorithm proposed is 94.05%, which is at least 4.29% higher than that of the model algorithm proposed by other scholars. The analysis of network data transmission synchronization performance suggests that there are obvious performance improvements in access delay, access collision rate, reliability, and network throughput. Among them, the packet loss rate is lower than 0.1, the access collision rate is basically stable at about 0, the access time is stable at about 75ms, and the sending throughput is basically maintained at about 1, which is significantly better than the performance of other algorithms. Therefore, the intelligent transportation system can achieve better data transmission performance under the premise of ensuring high prediction performance, with prominent instantaneity, which can provide experimental basis for the intelligent development of transportation in smart cities."",,This work was supported in part by “Basic tasks of technical forecasting” commissioned by the Chinese Academy of Science Technology for Development (CASTED) and in part by the College Scientific Research Project of China University of Political Science and Law under Grant 20ZFG63001.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2022-02-14,2022,2022-02-14,2023-02-01,24,2,2208-2216,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Yu, Miao"",""Yu, Miao (Business School, China University of Political Science and Law, Beijing, 100088, China)"",""Yu, Miao (China University of Political Science and Law)"",""Yu, Miao (China University of Political Science and Law)"",36,30,,16.37,https://doi.org/10.1109/tits.2022.3141731,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145531637,""35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services"; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences;" 4605 Data Management and Data Science"",3 Good Health and Well Being";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To guarantee the successful deployment of 5G, different aspects of device design, particularly those related to radio-frequency front end and antenna array for enabling beamformed communication, have to be accurately verified. It is more cost effective to identify design imperfections through lab testing rather than using field testing-based trial and error approaches, especially for the explosive growth of 5G-enabled Internet of Things devices. In this article, a directly connected over-the-air (OTA) test solution for 5G MIMO OTA evaluations with the focus on dynamic beamforming devices is proposed. The proposed solution can mathematically achieve constructions among the S ports of base station (BS) and U ports of the receiving antenna array, which makes it possible for measuring the throughput of terminal with an adaptive beamforming array in an OTA way. All system parameters are emulated, including S elements BS antenna gain, U elements of receiving terminal performance, and 3-D $S{\times }U$ propagation channel characteristics.

The results showed that P-LDPC outperforms its counterparts in terms of bit/ frame error rate (BER/ FER) behavior for given signal-to-noise ratios. Then, different P-LDPC settings were realized to study the effects of base graph selection (Graph1 or Graph2), code rate change (1/3 - 2/3), and block lengths increase (260 – 4160 bits). The simulation outcomes proved that BER performed better for lower coding rates or higher block lengths. Furthermore, P-LDPC behavior was examined over a Rayleigh flat-fading channel to achieve a 12.5 dB coding gain at 0.001 BER compared with uncoded transmission."",,,Tikrit Journal of Engineering Sciences,,,,2023-11-01,2023,2023-11-01,,30,4,1-10,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Al-Kadhimi, Aymen M."; Abdulkareem, Ammar E.;" Tsimenidis, Charalampos C."",""Al-Kadhimi, Aymen M.

As the core technology of contemporary mobile communication, 5G technology can not only meet the transportation needs of massive data traffic but also be expanded to various industries, expanding the development field of intelligent communication and realizing further improvement of production efficiency. At present, 5G mobile communication technology is widely used in communication engineering, providing effective technical support for engineering construction and operation. However, while the progress of the times brings innovation and refinement in mobile communication technology, it also increases the complexity of market development, in this context, the practical application of 5G technology in communication engineering is limited, which limits the development of both. In order to solve this dilemma, this paper integrated the communication method of the robot controller, and based on the analysis of the characteristics and application status of mobile communication technology, the application of 5G technology in communication engineering was deeply studied. In order to prove the effect of the robot controller communication method, in this paper, simulation experiments were carried out to analyze the application effect of 5G in communication engineering from three aspects of throughput rate, energy efficiency, and signal suppression effect and to compare it with traditional communication methods. The results of the signal suppression experiment showed that the average peak value of the signal under the traditional communication method was 18.134 dB, and the average peak value of the signal under the method in this paper was 11.296 dB, which showed that the 5G technology integrating the communication method of the robot controller is more practical in communication engineering."",Conflicts of Interest The author declares that there are no conflicts of interest.,,Journal of Robotics,,Iqbal Ahmad,,2023-04-08,2023,2023-04-08,2023-04-08,2023,1,1-9,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Chen, Yu"",""Chen, Yu (Office of Academic Affairs, Chongqing Industry Polytechnic College, Chongqing, China cqipc.net)"",""Chen, Yu (Chongqing Industry Polytechnic College)"",""Chen, Yu (Chongqing Industry Polytechnic College)"",2,2,,1.14,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jr/2023/1857590.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157113895,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We consider the coverage of an arbitrarily shaped service area (convex or non-convex) in an indoor environment by placing BSs/APs with varying transmit powers at appropriate locations such that every point in the indoor region under consideration will be covered by at least one BS. Towards this goal, we propose a Voronoi diagram-based BS placement framework that can completely cover a given convex/non-convex region without generating any coverage hole. Our placement technique considers the presence of different obstacles, partition walls, etc., of varying attenuation factors inside a building affecting the LOS propagation of signals in the mmWave range. Our proposed strategy simultaneously minimizes the total wastage of transmission powers of all BSs by minimizing the total area of overlapped regions and out-of-region coverages. The unique feature of our approach is that it is applicable for fully covering any convex or non-convex region in contrast to the existing coverage techniques in the literature, which are applicable only for convex regions. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing techniques for covering convex geometries in terms of the total transmission power requirement of all BSs/APs. Our proposed framework for the placement of access points will also be applicable for upcoming Wi-Fi standards such as the 802.11ad and the 802.11ay standards that can operate in the 60 GHz band."",,,Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering,,,,2022-07-25,2022,2022-07-25,2024-09,20,3,425-433,Closed,Article,""Das, Satya R."; Saha, Dibakar; Sinha, Bhabani P.;" Sinha, Koushik"",""Das, Satya R.

The main issues in the 5G network are insufficient user resources and burst errors, because it creates losses in data transmission. In order to overcome this, an effective Radio Resource Management (RRM) is required to be developed in the 5G network. In this paper, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed to develop the radio resource management in the 5G network. The proposed LSTM-RRM is used for assigning an adequate power and bandwidth to the desired user equipment of the network. Moreover, the Grid Search Optimization (GSO) is used for identifying the optimal hyperparameter values for LSTM. In radio resource management, a request queue is used to avoid the unwanted resource allocation in the network. Moreover, the losses during transmission are minimized by using frequency interleaving and guard level insertion. The performance of the LSTM-RRM method has been analyzed in terms of throughput, outage percentage, dual connectivity, User Sum Rate (USR), Threshold Sum Rate (TSR), Outdoor Sum Rate (OSR), threshold guaranteed rate, indoor guaranteed rate, and outdoor guaranteed rate. The indoor guaranteed rate of LSTM-RRM for 1400 m of building distance improved up to 75.38% compared to the existing QOC-RRM."",,This research received no external funding.,Future Internet,,,,2022-06-14,2022,2022-06-14,,14,6,184,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Balmuri, Kavitha Rani"; Konda, Srinivas; Lai, Wen-Cheng; Divakarachari, Parameshachari Bidare; Gowda, Kavitha Malali Vishveshwarappa;" Lingappa, Hemalatha Kivudujogappa"",""Balmuri, Kavitha Rani (Department of Information Technology, CMR Technical Campus, Hyderabad 501401, Telangana, India";, kavitharani.cse@cmrtc.ac.in); Konda, Srinivas (Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DS), CMR Technical Campus, Hyderabad 501401, Telangana, India;, srinivas.cse@cmrtc.ac.in); Lai, Wen-Cheng (Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin 64002, Taiwan); Divakarachari, Parameshachari Bidare (Department of TCE, GSSS Institute of Engineering and Technology for Women, Mysuru 570016, Karnataka, India;, paramesh@gsss.edu.in); Gowda, Kavitha Malali Vishveshwarappa (Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Gopalan College of Engineering and Management, Bengaluru 560048, Karnataka, India;, kavishanthagiri@gmail.com); Lingappa, Hemalatha Kivudujogappa (Department of ISE, Sri Krishna Institute of Technology, Bengaluru 560090, Karnataka, India;", isehod@skit.org.in)"",""Lai, Wen-Cheng (National Yunlin University of Science and Technology)"",""Balmuri, Kavitha Rani (Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad)"; Konda, Srinivas (Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad); Lai, Wen-Cheng (National Yunlin University of Science and Technology); Divakarachari, Parameshachari Bidare (Department of TCE, GSSS Institute of Engineering and Technology for Women, Mysuru 570016, Karnataka, India;, paramesh@gsss.edu.in); Gowda, Kavitha Malali Vishveshwarappa (Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Gopalan College of Engineering and Management, Bengaluru 560048, Karnataka, India;, kavishanthagiri@gmail.com); Lingappa, Hemalatha Kivudujogappa (Department of ISE, Sri Krishna Institute of Technology, Bengaluru 560090, Karnataka, India;", isehod@skit.org.in)"",35,33,,18.27,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/14/6/184/pdf?version=1655182205,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148672115,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Equivalent circuit model of the multilayer configuration with SICL is presented and verified by simulations.

The paper first provides an overview of 5G technology, its evolution, and how it revolutionised worldwide communication. The drivers of 5G, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC), will enable 5G to deliver higher speeds compared to the previous 4G and 3G generations and enable service providers to provide massive bandwidth catering to data-intensive applications such as Smart Cities. Besides human-computer interaction (HCI), smart cities include machine type communication (MTC), in which massive communication takes place between devices and the information infrastructure through gateways. A 5G network can successfully integrate the diversified service requirements and demands of smart city applications. Smart cities require massive IoT communication built into 5G. Multiple technologies are deployed in smart cities to enhance the standard of living for people. Citizens are provided with better health services, improved transportation, efficient energy, quality education, and safety and security to public. In this survey paper we present the contribution of 5G in the deployment of smart city applications and its pillars that play a very important role in the construction of smart cities. Better healthcare systems have been developed that integrate new communication technologies and conventional health care procedures. One of the vital segments of a smart city is its transportation system, which affects the environs and health of people. The energy efficiency of smart cities can be greatly improved by 5G by using smart appliances. Smart metres deliver real-time data about the energy consumed. Users can save energy and money. Similarly, it can assist the water board team by giving real-time statistics regarding water consumption to the consumers. Almost all the smart city infrastructure mentioned above has different requirements for delay, movement, dependability, and resilience of the network. Incorporating diverse applications into a communication network is a difficult chore. 5G has been designed for forward compatibility to support future amenities not known today.

As traditional smart campus data networks suffer from long construction periods, high costs, and poor flexibility of wired networks, existing wireless networks may suffer from audio delays, lagging, and other problems. Now with the addition of 5G networks, it is not only able to provide a new design concept and teaching method for modern teaching, but it is also of great significance to improve the comprehensive strength of schools and accelerate the construction and implementation of teacher support service models. In this paper, we investigate URLLC and eMBB multiplexing mechanisms in 5G, introduce the signal space diversity technique based on rotational modulation, and propose SSD-based URLLC and eMBB multiplexing mechanisms. The SSD-based URLLC and eMBB multiplexing mechanisms are validated through downlink-level simulations. The results show that the BER is improved by about 1.0dB at 10-6 orders of magnitude, and the BER is improved by about 1.0dB at 10-3 orders of magnitude under the simulation verification of the Rayleigh channel compared to the case without spatial diversity. In the simulation of the spatial diversity multiplexing mechanism of the TDL-A-1000 channel, the BER is improved by about 1.5dB at 10-6 orders of magnitude, and the BER is also improved by about 1.5dB at 10-3 orders of magnitude compared with the case without spatial diversity. In summary, the SSD-based multiplexing mechanism proposed in this paper can reduce data BER, improve data transmission reliability, and make the construction and implementation of the teacher support services model in smart education faster and more convenient."",,,Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,,,,2023-08-11,2023,2023-08-11,2024-01-01,9,1,20230165,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Wang, Jun"",""Wang, Jun (Guangdong University of Science and Technology, Dongguan, Guangdong, 523808, China, .)"",""Wang, Jun (Guangdong University of Science and Technology, Dongguan, Guangdong, 523808, China, .)"",""Wang, Jun (Guangdong University of Science and Technology, Dongguan, Guangdong, 523808, China, .)"",2,2,,1.7,https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/amns.2023.2.00165,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163910377,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"698,pub.1156265261,10.1093/comjnl/bxad023,,,Extremely Lightweight Constant-Round Membership-Authenticated Group Key Establishment for Resource-Constrained Smart Environments toward 5G,""Abstract With rapid development of next-generation mobile networks and communications (5G networks), group-oriented applications in resource-constrained smart environments (RSEs), such as smart homes and smart classrooms, have attracted great attentions. Due to the insecure communications between resource-constrained devices, secure group communications in RSE toward 5G face many challenges. In RSE toward 5G, lightweight communications and low computational overheads are crucial. Besides, the private tokens used to generate the group key are expected to be reused multiple times. However, the conventional frameworks for secure group communications cannot meet these requirements. A practical construction of extremely lightweight constant-round membership authenticated group key establishment framework is proposed in this paper for RSE toward 5G, which not only implements identity authentication among the members and group key establishment but also ensures extremely lightweight computation and communication costs by each group member. In our proposed scheme, the increase in the number of group members will not lead to a linear or logarithmic increase in the communication and calculation costs at the member side. Our framework also resists external and internal attacks and meets all the desirable security features. In this framework, the privacy of tokens can be well protected, so that they can be reused for multiple times. Therefore, our scheme significantly reduces the costs of communication and calculation, and it is more efficient compared with the related schemes in the literature. This proposal is fairly suitable for lightweight membership authentication and group key establishment in RSE toward 5G."",,""National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 62172181, 62072133)";" the key projects of Guangxi Natural Science Foundation (no. 2018GXNSFDA281040)."",The Computer Journal,,,,2023-03-17,2023,2023-03-17,2024-04-14,67,3,840-850,Closed,Article,""Hsu, Chingfang"; Xia, Zhe; Cheng, Tianshu;" Harn, Lein"",""Hsu, Chingfang (Computer School, Central China Normal University, 152 Luoyu Avenue, Wuhan 430079, China)"; Xia, Zhe (Department of Computer Science, Wuhan University of Technology, 122 Luoshi Avenue, Wuhan 430071, China); Cheng, Tianshu (No.1 Middle School Affiliated to Central China Normal University, 281 Zhuodaoquan Avenue 45100 Rockhill Road, Wuhan 430079, China);" Harn, Lein (Department of Computer Science Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, MO 64110, USA)"",""Xia, Zhe (Wuhan University of Technology)"",""Hsu, Chingfang (Central China Normal University)"; Xia, Zhe (Wuhan University of Technology); Cheng, Tianshu (Central China Normal University);" Harn, Lein (University of Missouri–Kansas City)"",1,1,,0.81,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156265261,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in complex environments such as urban canyons, GNSS performance is often degraded due to signal occlusion and even fails to achieve positioning due to the insufficient visible satellites. Because of the characteristics of large bandwidth, low latency, and high Base Station (BS) density, the fifth-Generation mobile communication (5G) technology has gradually become a trend for positioning in cities while offering traditional communication service. To supply the communication demands of the User Equipment (UE), only one BS is usually considered to establish a connection with the UE during the BS construction. However, the positioning accuracy with a single BS in urban canyons will be significantly reduced. To further improve the positioning accuracy in such extreme scenarios, this paper proposes a simplified 5G/GNSS fusion positioning system architecture using observations from only a 5G BS and a GNSS satellite. In this system, the GNSS receiver is mounted on the 5G BS, and the measurements provided by the receiver are used to form the differential code and complete the position estimation. The positioning mathematical models of the system based on the original code and differential code are derived. Then, the impacts of the measurements noise and the time synchronization error on the positioning accuracy are analyzed theoretically. Finally, the positioning performance is investigated by a set of simulation experiments. Numerical results show that under the existing 5G measurement noise and 2 m’s code measurement noise, the improvement of the differential code based fusion positioning compared with the 5G-only positioning is more than 32%, which is also about 6% higher than the original code based fusion positioning. Besides, this improvement is not affected by the time synchronization error between the BS and the GNSS satellite."",,This work is supported by the National tural Science Foundation of ChinaNa [grant number 41974038] and NaThe tional Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2018YFC0809804].,Geo-spatial Information Science,,,,2023-01-02,2023,2023-01-17,2023-01-02,26,1,94-106,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Guo, Chi"; Qi, Shufeng; Guo, Wenfei; Deng, Chenlong;" Liu, Jingnan"",""Guo, Chi (GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"; Hubei Luojia Laboratory, Wuhan, China); Qi, Shufeng (GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China); Guo, Wenfei (GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Hubei Luojia Laboratory, Wuhan, China); Deng, Chenlong (GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; Hubei Luojia Laboratory, Wuhan, China); Liu, Jingnan (GNSS Research Center, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China;" Hubei Luojia Laboratory, Wuhan, China)"",""Guo, Wenfei (Wuhan University";" Wuhan University)"",""Guo, Chi (Wuhan University"; Wuhan University); Qi, Shufeng (Wuhan University); Guo, Wenfei (Wuhan University; Wuhan University); Deng, Chenlong (Wuhan University; Wuhan University); Liu, Jingnan (Wuhan University;" Wuhan University)"",9,9,,7.77,https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2022.2144481,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154602519,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Distributed marketplaces aim at facilitating stakeholders in the quest and hiring of third party resources and services. Establishing trustworthiness in such an open ecosystem is a cornerstone for the final deployment of these marketplaces in 5G networks and beyond. Hence, building trust management systems that ensure the selection of reliable parties or assets in 5G distributed marketplaces is essential. Thus, a reputation-based trust management framework is proposed to analyze stakeholder behavior patterns and predict trust scores to establish trustworthy relationships across domains. Furthermore, an Service Level Agreement (SLA)-driven reward and punishment mechanism is designed and developed on top of the reputation-based trust framework. Such a mechanism enables continuously adapting trust scores by gathering breach predictions, breach detections, and SLA violations in real time. Furthermore, an edge-based use case is presented to contextualize our reputation-based framework in a tangible enforcement scenario.

However, the susceptibility of mmWave signals to severe path loss and shadowing requires the use of highly directional antennas. Since the narrow beams are vulnerable to blockages, the interference behaviour becomes the key factor in building the network. In this paper, we propose a blockage model by considering the distribution of buildings in the cell as a Poisson point process. We analytically derive the blockage probability using the queuing theory. Subsequently, we derive the interference statistics using the blockage model considering the spatial randomness of the locations of blockages and User Equipments (UEs).

Many scenic spots in China are conforming to trends of the times by embarking on this transformation and beginning to become smart scenic spots. Yet these sites continue to face challenges in the process of smart construction. Moreover, theoretical guidance on the smart construction of scenic spots is lacking. We adopted a questionnaire survey method to study smart construction at 5A and 4A scenic spots in China. Based on the results, we established a smart scenic spot evaluation system via the Delphi method and the analytic hierarchy process. Our proposed system included infrastructure construction, smart service, smart management, and smart marketing as primary indicators. With the help of a geographic information system, we also discovered that scenic spots' locations influence smart construction.

We are currently in the development phase of 5G cellular networks on the way to their transformation to 6G. 5G has become a truly revolutionary technology, able to use all available advantages, technologies and create the digital world of the future. Therefore, 5GPPP within the framework of the Horizon 2020 program was granted funding for a large number of research projects, the purpose of which was to test the proposed innovative solutions, to combine efforts with cellular operators, vendors, etc., in order to test the real capabilities of 5G and demonstrate all the advantages to vertical industries. One of these flagship projects was 5G-TOURS. The 5G-TOURS project was aimed at improving mobility systems in the city, the e-Health industry and the tourism sector. Thus, within the framework of 5G-TOURS project was developed the special methodology for assessment of QoE and QoS and mapping between these parameters. To apply developed evaluation methodology for all the use cases of the project is very difficult, as it needs a lot of additional efforts by the partners, additional testing tools, testing procedures, etc. That is why it was decided to apply the developed approach only to one use cases in which it was possible to collect all the required data. Thus, UC 4 “High quality video service distribution” was under study to ensure the applicability of the developed approach. All the experiments were conducted in Turin, wherein a movable car, specially equipped, collected QoE and QoS data for further analysis. Thus, the methodological approach was confirmed by the results of the conducted experiments. And in the future, similar models can be developed to study the correlations of service quality parameters and user experience for any developed use cases."",,,International Journal of Computing,,,,2023-12-31,2023,2023-12-31,,,,462-474,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Odarchenko, Roman"",""Odarchenko, Roman ()"",,""Odarchenko, Roman ()"",0,0,,0.0,https://computingonline.net/computing/article/view/3353/1123,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167668187,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The conventional IFA is modified to make the structure compact and efficient. The additional IFAs are aligned in face‐to‐face configuration to reduce the coupling between them up to some extent. Furthermore, a novel decoupling element is incorporated between antenna pairs to effectively enhance the isolation. As a result, the proposed building block exhibits isolation higher than 28.2 dB between two adjacent ports. Based on highly isolated building blocks, a 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 multi‐input multi‐output (MIMO) antenna array is designed and investigated which is operated in 3.5 GHz (LTE band 42). The proposed 8 × 8 MIMO antenna array has four compact building blocks and reserves sufficient space for integrating other antennas such as 2G/3G/4G antennas. To validate the simulated results, a prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated and tested. Over the entire operating frequency, the fabricated 8 × 8 MIMO antenna array obtain high isolation of more than 27.3 dB, and high antenna efficiency (>61%). Also, its corresponding measured envelope correlation coefficients are lower than 0.04 and channel capacity was about 39.1–40.6 bps/Hz.

"                    This paper proposed an MPC-based time synchronization method for V2V communication under 5G-R. Through the construction of MPC controllers for clocks of adjacent vehicles, time synchronization was realized for V2V communication under 5G-R by using control means such as multistep prediction, rolling optimization, and feedback correction. In view of the problems of low synchronization precision and slow convergence speed caused by packet loss with existing synchronization methods, the observer equation was introduced to estimate the clock state of the adjacent vehicles in case of packet loss, which reduces the impact of clock error caused by packet loss in the synchronization process and improves the synchronization precision of V2V communication.

High millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies present a high signal loss and low signal strength, particularly during signal propagation in indoor areas. It is considerably difficult to design indoor wireless communication systems through deterministic modeling owing to the complex nature of the construction materials and environmental changes caused by human interactions. This study presents a methodology of data-driven techniques that will be applied to predict path loss using artificial intelligence. The proposed methodology enables the prediction of signal loss in an indoor environment with an accuracy of 97.4%."",Author appreciates the support and fund that were provided by Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University.,This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University (award number 2021/01/19042).,Electronics,,,,2023-01-18,2023,2023-01-18,,12,3,497,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Aldossari, Saud Alhajaj"",""Aldossari, Saud Alhajaj (Department of Electrical Engineering, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Wadi Addwasir 11991, Saudi Arabia)"",,""Aldossari, Saud Alhajaj (Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University)"",13,13,,10.09,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/3/497/pdf?version=1675160816,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154698580,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The mMTC and URLLC functions of 5G are especially crucial for ensuring the connectivity and communication needs of rapidly moving IoVs. In this backdrop, network virtualization, cognitive computing along with smart spectrum resource management to the virtual networks will play a key role in solving the spectrum resource challenge. In this article, we propose a dynamic carrier resource allocation scheme for supporting IoV systems in smart cities enabled by cloud radio access networks (CRAN)-based 5G carriers. In CRAN-based 5G networks, the carrier resource allocated to the virtual networks can be centrally managed and shared to meet the dynamic demand of cell capacities caused by the rapid movement of IoVs, and the response to this dynamic allocation will become more time critical. The proposed cognitive carrier resource optimization is achieved by enhancing the ability to predict movement of IoVs, hence the dynamically changing demand for carrier resources. As an enhancement of the traditional Markov Model, our prediction model introduces vehicles' mobility analysis in order to allow the construction of a more precise flow transition matrix to improve the prediction result. Numerical results are provided to show the performance improvement of the proposed method."",""This research is supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative.

"669,pub.1145131085,10.1109/tase.2022.3143832,,,A Novel Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing Based on Container Technology and Cloud Manufacturing Services,""Many core technologies of Industry 4.0 have gained substantial advancement in recent years. Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology and tool for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent cyber-physical integration and digital transformation by leveraging these technologies. Although there have been many DT-related works, there is no standard definition, unified framework, and implementation approach of DT until now. Widely developing DTs for the manufacturing industry is still challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a novel implementation framework of digital twins for intelligent manufacturing, denoted as IF-DTiM, which possesses several distinct merits to distinguish itself from previous works. First, IF-DTiM fully utilizes new-generation container technology so that DT-related applications and services can be packaged in a self-contained way, rapidly deployed, and robustly operated with the capabilities of failover, autoscaling, and load balancing. Second, it leverages existing intelligent cloud manufacturing services to realize the intelligence for DT externally in a scalable and plug-and-play manner instead of using traditional approaches to embed intelligence in DT. Third, IF-DTiM contains Product DT for products, Equipment DT (i.e., EQ DT) for equipment, and Process DT for production lines, which can generically fulfill the demands and scenarios to achieve intelligent manufacturing for various manufacturing industries. Testing results show that IF-DTiM can achieve remarkable performance in rapid deployment and real-time data exchanges of DT-related applications. Finally, we develop an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM to demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in facilitating the manufacturing industry to build their DT systems. Note to Practitioners—Developing Digital Twin (DT) systems to realize intelligent manufacturing is challenging. The proposed IF-DTiM (Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing) provides a novel container-technology and cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology for building DTiM. In this paper, we present the system architecture and several operational scenarios (e.g., how to create and use DTs) of IF-DTiM, together with the design of its core functional mechanisms (e.g., rapid deployment scheme for DT, real-time data exchange for DT, DT interface pattern, and general workflow architecture for DT). Also, an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM is presented to facilitate the practitioners to adopt the designs and niches in IF-DTiM to build their desired DTiM systems."",""The authors thank Tongai and Dassault Systèmes for providing the CT-350 CNC machine, manipulator, Ranishaw measurement equipment, and the 3DEXPERIENCE platform for demonstrating the testing results of Product DT and EQ DT."",""This work was supported in part by the Intelligent Manufacturing Research Center (iMRC) through the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan";" and in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Contract MOST 110-2218-E-006-027, Contract MOST 108-2221-E-034-015-MY2, Contract MOST 110-2221-E-034-009-MY2, and Contract MOST 110-2221-E-006-124."",IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,,,,2022-01-31,2022,2022-01-31,2022-07-01,19,3,1614-1630,Closed,Article,""Hung, Min-Hsiung"; Lin, Yu-Chuan; Hsiao, Hung-Chang; Chen, Chao-Chun; Lai, Kuan-Chou; Hsieh, Yu-Ming; Tieng, Hao; Tsai, Tsung-Han; Huang, Hsien-Cheng; Yang, Haw-Ching;" Cheng, Fan-Tien"",""Hung, Min-Hsiung (Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chinese Culture University, Taipei, 111396, Taiwan)"; Lin, Yu-Chuan (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Hsiao, Hung-Chang (Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Chen, Chao-Chun (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Lai, Kuan-Chou (Department of Computer Science, National Taichung University of Education, Taichung, 40306, Taiwan); Hsieh, Yu-Ming (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Tieng, Hao (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Tsai, Tsung-Han (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Huang, Hsien-Cheng (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan); Yang, Haw-Ching (Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, 82444, Taiwan);" Cheng, Fan-Tien (Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, 701401, Taiwan)"",""Hung, Min-Hsiung (Chinese Culture University)"",""Hung, Min-Hsiung (Chinese Culture University)"; Lin, Yu-Chuan (National Cheng Kung University); Hsiao, Hung-Chang (National Cheng Kung University); Chen, Chao-Chun (National Cheng Kung University); Lai, Kuan-Chou (National Taichung University of Education); Hsieh, Yu-Ming (National Cheng Kung University); Tieng, Hao (National Cheng Kung University); Tsai, Tsung-Han (National Cheng Kung University); Huang, Hsien-Cheng (National Cheng Kung University); Yang, Haw-Ching (National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology);" Cheng, Fan-Tien (National Cheng Kung University)"",47,42,,16.88,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145131085,40 Engineering";" 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nowadays, the requirement of quality of life and tightening energy efficiency regulations of buildings promote the demand for new construction materials. However, limited by the size and inhomogeneous structure, the thermal conductivity measurement of wall samples becomes a demanding topic. Additionally, we find the thermal parameter values of the samples measured in the laboratory are different from those obtained by theoretical computation. In this paper, a novel signal-transmissive wall is designed to provide the problem solving of signal connectivity in 5G.

Four T-shaped antennas and a shared rectangular ground are the components of a uniplanar common ground MIMO system, and no decoupling components are employed for isolation. Because of their straightforward construction and ease of integration into handsets, uniplanar configurations are being used. The MIMO antennas cover the bandwidth of 3.37 GHz with a mid-frequency of 4.5 GHz covering the entire sub-6 GHz mid-band frequencies ranges from 3 to 6.37 GHz including the NR bands of n46/n47/n48/n77/n78/n79.

With the value of diversity gain = 10 dB, error control code < 0.03, total active reflection coefficient < − 8 dB, and MEG < − 3 dB, the ground-centered MIMO adequately performs diversity. To confirm that the suggested MIMO is a suitable 5G handset system, the complete configuration is assessed for the users’ left-hand and dual-hand specific absorption rate influences.

With the support of 5G network technology and environment, integrating 5G+VR technology into financial literacy courses has become a new challenge. This study aims to enrich students’ learning experience, promote education reform, and bring a new perspective to financial literacy education research by creating financial literacy education scenes. In the context of financial literacy learning, games are a fast and effective learning tool. The subject of this research is to use the visual and interactive features of AR/VR to design a game-based teaching scene that is consistent with the teaching content, attractive, and stimulates students’ interest in learning to improve the learning effect. With the help of 5G+VR technology, students’ classroom experience has transformed from 2D to 3D, from the plane content presented in textbooks and blackboards to more three-dimensional content. For some abstract or invisible content, AR/VR can display visually, which helps to improve cognition and understanding. The specific development process includes three parts. First, determining the development content and designing the script based on the course content and teaching objectives. The second part is communicating with the design company to carry out specific scene development, creating VR scene buildings, objects, characters, etc., and optimizing the scene design.

On this scope, the proposed system develops Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and Distributed Particle Filtering Evaluation Scheme (DPFES) for constructing a secure and cooperative multi-watchdog system. The proposed Deep Learning (DL) based dynamic multi-watchdog system protects each sensor node by monitoring the node transmission. In addition, the proposed work encompasses secure data-centric and node-centric evaluation procedures that are required for expanding the secure medium of 5G-based IoT-WSN networks.

Notably, the proposed work contains a system dynamics model, cooperative watchdog model, Dual Line Minimum Connected Dominating Set (DL-MCDS), and DL-based event analysis procedures. Based on technical aspects, the proposed system is motivated to implement DPFES to analyze network events using particle filtering frameworks to build a secure 5G environment.

In addition, the new features introduced by 5G networks have been recognized to be beneficial to wireless localization. In this study, we investigate the performance of indoor localization with commercial 5G new radio (NR) signals, and the channel state information (CSI) is used for localization, which is acquired from the synchronization signal block (SSB) of the downlink physical channel. A hybrid indoor localization system named Hi-Loc has been developed. Initially, a feature enhancement module is designed to generate new features from the SSB CSI, and a data construction module is applied to prepare the dataset for subsequent localization algorithms. By introducing the dual-attention mechanism deep network with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), a feature-based attention mechanism and a sample-based attention mechanism are designed to extract the implicit spatial and time information of CSI, respectively. Finally, in the online stage, by applying a fully connected neural network (FCNN), the 2-D coordinates are estimated based on the corresponding CSI features. We carry out indoor field tests in the typical office and corridor scenario. The results show that Hi-Loc achieves mean absolute errors of 0.65 and 1.03 m in the internal test cases of the office scenario and the corridor scenario, respectively, and 1.93 and 3.10 m in the external test cases of the office scenario and the corridor scenario, respectively, indicating its superiority over the compared CSI fingerprint-based methods in localization accuracy."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 42171417, in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Hubei Province under Grant 2021BAA166, and in part by the Special Fund of the Hubei Luojia Laboratory under Grant 220100008."",IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-08-11,2022-01-01,71,,1-15,Closed,Article,""Ruan, Yanlin"; Chen, Liang; Zhou, Xin; Guo, Guangyi;" Chen, Ruizhi"",""Ruan, Yanlin (State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China)"; Chen, Liang (State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China); Zhou, Xin (State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China); Guo, Guangyi (State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China);" Chen, Ruizhi (State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430079, China)"",""Chen, Liang (Wuhan University)"",""Ruan, Yanlin (Wuhan University)"; Chen, Liang (Wuhan University); Zhou, Xin (Wuhan University); Guo, Guangyi (Wuhan University);" Chen, Ruizhi (Wuhan University)"",50,48,,25.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150163997,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The results show the minimum SINR value of LoS channel is -13 dB and minimum SINR value of NLoS is -25.68 dB over the variation of distance from 10m to 400m, where the threshold SINR value is -10dB. The minimum transport block loss in the physical layer is 20% in 5 nodes whereas 60% in 40 nodes with constant distance 150m between gNB and UE in the NLoS channel. The maximum delay found is less than 1.5 millisecond. The Friis propagation loss model is used in the LoS channel whereas the millimeter wave propagation loss as well as the shadowing model is used in the NLoS channel.

However, with the evolving cyber threat landscape, IoT devices have become more vulnerable to the broader risk surface (e.g., risks associated with generative AI, 5G-IoT, etc.), which, if exploited, may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of command and control and potential harm. This paper reviews the fundamentals of healthcare IoT, its privacy, and data security challenges associated with machine learning and H-IoT devices. The paper further emphasizes the importance of monitoring healthcare IoT layers such as perception, network, cloud, and application. Detecting and responding to anomalies involves various cyber-attacks and protocols such as Wi-Fi 6, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, and 5G New Radio (5G NR). A robust authentication mechanism based on machine learning and deep learning techniques is required to protect and mitigate H-IoT devices from increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

To mitigate the security risk of 5G data leakage, building covert channel is an alternative approach of providing confidential data transmission. Due to the high transmission rate of 5G, the interpacket intervals become small and derandomized, this caused the encoding phase of the covert timing channel imports relatively large modulation errors. rearranging is a widespread phenomenon that is occurred over the data communications. In this paper, we propose a rearrangement covert channel approach named Hybrid Variable‐length Packet Rearrangement Covert Timing Channel (HVPR‐CTC), which artificially chooses the delimiter packets and identification (ID) packets from the overt traffics, and encodes the packet sending order between adjacent delimiter packets according to a generated hybrid variable‐length codeword dictionary, and embeds the secret message by rearranging the sending order of the ID packets. The experiments demonstrate that the HVPR‐CTC scheme can effectively perform strategy adjustment: its minimum Location Square Deviation is 0.832 and minimum Swap Deviation is 139. the maximum throughput reaches 14.37 bps, and the optimal Bit Error Rate is 3.27% and 9.70% for low‐channel noise and high‐channel noise communication conditions, respectively."",This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos.

Realizing that may greatly simplify the deployment and operation of these surfaces and reduce the infrastructure control overhead. This paper investigates the feasibility of building standalone/transparent RIS systems and shows that one key challenge lies in determining the user equipment (UE)-side RIS beam reflection direction. To address this challenge, we propose to equip the RISs with multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., using wireless and visual sensors) that enable them to develop some perception of the surrounding environment and the mobile users. Based on that, we develop a machine learning framework that leverages the wireless and visual sensors at the RIS to select the high-performance beams between the base station (BS) and UEs and enable standalone/transparent RIS operation for 5G high-frequency systems. Using a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with co-existing wireless and visual data, we extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict the BS and UE-side candidate beams, and that the standalone RIS beam selection solution is capable of realizing near-optimal achievable rates with significantly reduced beam training overhead."",,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 2048021.,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2023-08-15,2023,2023-08-15,2023-11-01,71,11,6348-6362,All OA";" Green,Article,""Jiang, Shuaifeng"; Hindy, Ahmed;" Alkhateeb, Ahmed"",""Jiang, Shuaifeng (School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, USA)"; Hindy, Ahmed (Motorola Mobility LLC (a Lenovo Company), Chicago, IL, 60654, USA);" Alkhateeb, Ahmed (School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, 85281, USA)"",""Alkhateeb, Ahmed (Arizona State University)"",""Jiang, Shuaifeng (Arizona State University)"; Hindy, Ahmed (Motorola (United States));" Alkhateeb, Ahmed (Arizona State University)"",6,6,,4.75,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13487,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163300026,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper first maps a polar code to a unique heterogeneous graph called the polar-code-construction message-passing (PCCMP) graph. Next, a heterogeneous graph-neural-network-based iterative message-passing (IMP) algorithm is proposed which aims to find a PCCMP graph that corresponds to the polar code with minimum frame error rate under CA-SCL decoding. This new IMP algorithm’s major advantage lies in its scalability power. That is, the model complexity is independent of the blocklength and code rate, and a trained IMP model over a short polar code can be readily applied to a long polar code’s construction. Numerical experiments show that IMP-based polar-code constructions outperform classical constructions under CA-SCL decoding. In addition, when an IMP model trained on a length-128 polar code directly applies to the construction of polar codes with different code rates and blocklengths, simulations show that these polar-code constructions deliver comparable performance to the 5G polar codes."",The authors thank Samsung Electronics for their kind support of this work under the Stanford Metaverse Project.,,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2023-08-15,2023,2023-08-15,2023-11-01,71,11,6231-6245,All OA";" Green,Article,""Liao, Yun"; Hashemi, Seyyed Ali; Yang, Hengjie;" Cioffi, John M."",""Liao, Yun (Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA)"; Hashemi, Seyyed Ali (Qualcomm Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, 95051, USA); Yang, Hengjie (Qualcomm Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA, 92121, USA);" Cioffi, John M.

First, the response characteristics of the 5G base station energy storage demand are analyzed. Second, a microgrid hybrid power supply system is proposed. Third, a multimicrogrid demand response hierarchical optimal scheduling model based on the game is constructed, and the game interaction mechanism between various stakeholders in the demand response is studied. Finally, the strategy of each microgrid in the IEEE-9 bus system in the game bidding is simulated by a genetic algorithm (GA), and the simulation experiment is carried out by Matlab. The results show that (1) after the optimization of the multimicrogrid system, the overall load of the microgrid is reduced, the independent energy optimization is carried out according to the energy access of each microgrid, and renewable energy is fully used. (2) Based on the game-based time-sharing bidding strategy, the system gives priority to the low-cost microgrid for power supply and saves the cost. (3) The load transfer capacity of the three microgrids obtained by the model are 132.7 kW, 47.1 kW, and 46.4 kW, which is within the actual load range of each microgrid"; their electricity sales are 665.8 kWh, 2053.3 kWh, and 1668.2 kWh;" and their income is 132.45 CNY, 411.72 CNY, and 354.63 CNY, respectively. This shows that the game equilibrium index makes the power sales of each microgrid proportional to its income, which ensures the fair and effective scheduling in the bidding process.

Nonetheless, the most widespread beamforming solutions are based on electrical implementation, which is inefficient in terms of power consumption, signal bandwidth, and losses. Optical beamforming is a promising alternative for future mm-wave mobile communications due to its inherent benefits, such as large bandwidth, low cross-talk, and low losses. Optical beamforming networks (OBFN) are an outstanding technique to simultaneously generate and radiate multiple beams in an effective manner. True time delays (TTDs) based on optical waveguides are an attractive solution since they offer constant delay in the spectrum to avoid beam squint and allow highly scalable OBFN implementation. In this work, for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge, an incoherent 4x4 OBFN based on optical waveguides and capable of simultaneously generating four beams is presented, including a thorough explanation of its operating principles and providing a detailed characterization. The presented OBFN is fabricated on Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ photonic integrated circuit (PIC), and designed for transmission at 27.5 GHz, within the n257 5G band. Furthermore, the building blocks forming the OBFN PIC are deeply explained, providing their corresponding theoretical formulation and key design parameters. The fabricated PIC is exhaustively characterized through all its building blocks, showing in detail the realized measurement procedure. The experimental measures match the design parameters with minimal error, showing the feasibility of fabricating future OBFNs with the same technology and topology for larger antenna arrays. The experimental results corroborate the viability of the presented OBFN architecture as an excellent technology to consider in future mm-wave 5G/6G networks. The contribution of this work paves the road to turn optical beamforming into a mature, scalable, and efficient technology."",,This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon2020 Research and Innovation Program through the ITN 5G STEP-FWD and blueSPACE Projects under Grants 722429 and 762055.,Journal of Lightwave Technology,,,,2022-11-14,2022,2022-11-14,,41,5,1325-1334,All OA";" Green,Article,""Santacruz, Javier Prez"; Rommel, Simon; Roeloffzen, Chris G.

Because of the characteristics of mmWave, it is suitable for Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service in subway tunnel scenarios, in which there are increasing data rate requirement of passengers to be satisfied. To this end, we propose a new scheme of Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) plus small stations in the carriage, in which the backhaul link is 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) networking with 4G for master node and 5G mmWave for secondary node, so as to overcome the handover burden and penetration loss of mmWave, that is more severe in the high-frequency range. Based on the existing old 4G equipment, mmWave is applied for 5G user-plane connection in NSA dual connection, while the control plane connection still relies on 4G commercial frequency band, in order that even if the millimeter-wave link quality is seriously degraded, the IAB-node can still maintain the connection with the master node and re-establish the mmWave link through the exchange of control information on the 4G low-frequency band. Unlike previous attempts, the proposed approach applies dual link to the backhaul link and 5G commercial frequency band to the in-vehicle access link of small station with Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing technology, so that the bandwidth shared by the operators can be aggregated in one small station and fully used for user access to match the mmWave large bandwidth of the backhaul link. Field trials showed that although the data rates were somewhat unstable at the handover points, which still need to be improved in the future work, the average end-to-end uplink and downlink data rates were greatly improved, compared to the previous average data rates when only outdoor signal penetrating indoors was used in subway tunnel. In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce the operator’s construction and maintenance costs by making full use of the existing 4G equipment, which provides a reference for upgrading 4G to 5G signal coverage for all tunnel scenarios."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-10-09,2023-01-01,11,,112348-112361,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Zhao, Xiaoyin"; Qi, Fei;" Xie, Weiliang"",""Zhao, Xiaoyin (Department of Mobile Communication and Terminal Technology, China Telecom Corporation Ltd.

This article evaluated the use of granite rock powder, a mining residue, as an adsorbent for the Basazol Yellow 5G (BY5G) dye and the reuse of the residue generated by the by treating this effluent in construction products. Characterization of the adsorbent material by N2 physisorption indicated a surface area of 1514 m2 g−1. Energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the presence of silica in the sample and the absence of amorphous halos. The kinetic study showed a removal of approximately 98% at 298 K, and the pseudo-second-order model obtained the best fit. The adsorption isotherm satisfied the Langmuir model and was consistent with the L-type isotherm. The negative value of the Gibbs energy (ΔG°) and the positive value of the enthalpy (ΔH°) indicate that the process is spontaneous and endothermic. The activation energy (Ea) indicates the occurrence of chemical adsorption. The desorption rate was low for the adsorbate, demonstrating the possibility of using residual adsorbent material as a filler in mortar and concrete.

The model is a two-phase queuing system (QS). In the QS, at the first phase, the prediction process with the possibility of relaying is modeled, and at the second phase, the process of message processing by the user terminal based on the HARQ physical layer protocol is considered. The HARQ protocol in the 5G network provides the transmitter with an acknowledgment message ACK in case of successful decoding of the packet, and NACK in case of error. Its main disadvantage is the limitation on RTT (Round Trip Time) - the time interval between the initial and retransmission processes. Numerical analysis of the obtained probabilistic-temporal characteristics (PTCR) is carried out. At the first stage, the transition probabilities were found by modeling the link layer of the 5G network. Obtaining realistic values for the transition probabilities allows using this analytical model to analyze and optimize existing e-HARQ prediction schemes.

We are currently implementing the 5G system, which is replacing the previous cellular technologies on the market. Parallel to the development of cellular technologies, wireless local networks based on the IEEE 802.11× standards are rapidly spreading. The desire to use the advantages of both mobile telephony and wireless local networks has led to the idea of integrating the currently used communication systems in one device and requires a well-designed antenna, which should be given a lot of attention when designing the radio system. This article presents the proposed model of a two-band microstrip antenna for which the main assumption is its operating frequencies in the LTE-U (LTE-Unlicensed) band and one of the 5G system bands. The antenna dimensions and parameters have been calculated, simulated, and optimized using CST Microwave Studio software. The developed antenna has a compact structure with dimensions of (60 × 40 × 1.57) mm.

The proposed RoF system does not require a power-hungry digital-to-analog converter in access points and relaxes the operation speed of optical transceivers to reduce device cost. We introduce two configurations to enable 1-bit outphasing modulation in our system";" mixed-signal and all-digital configurations. In the mixed-signal configuration, the effects of harmonics and phase/amplitude mismatch on the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) were analyzed through simulation, and wideband transmission with a signal bandwidth of 400 MHz was experimentally verified, complying with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard for millimeter-wave band. Moreover, wide-band transmission with a signal bandwidth of 1 GHz was also experimentally verified for beyond-5G and 6G. The all-digital configuration can be implemented in a standard digital design flow. This configuration was also verified to comply with the 3GPP standard by properly selecting the intermediate and sampling frequencies to mitigate the effects of folded harmonics and quantization noise. Finally, the proposed RoF system with both configurations has been shown to have a higher bandwidth efficiency compared with other systems complying with the 3GPP standard for the ACLR. Therefore, the proposed RoF system provides a cost-effective in-building wireless solution for 5G and 6G mobile network systems."",,,IEICE Transactions on Electronics,,,,2023-07-01,2023,2023-07-01,2023-07-01,E106.C,7,405-416,Closed,Article,""Yuma, KASE"; Shinichi, HORI; OSHIMA, Naoki;" KUNIHIRO, Kazuaki"",""Yuma, KASE (NEC Corporation)"; Shinichi, HORI (NEC Corporation); OSHIMA, Naoki (NEC Corporation);" KUNIHIRO, Kazuaki (NEC Corporation)"",,""Yuma, KASE (NEC (Japan))"; Shinichi, HORI (NEC (Japan)); OSHIMA, Naoki (NEC (Japan));" KUNIHIRO, Kazuaki (NEC (Japan))"",1,1,,0.74,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153879428,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the context of fifth-generation (5G) and future networks, co-construction and sharing among multiple telecom operators, which effectively mitigate challenges stemming from resource scarcity, energy consumption, and network construction costs, also attract wide attention. Therefore, optimal resource allocation techniques in sharing networks should be explored. Current resource allocation schemes primarily optimize for load balancing, single-user throughput, and fairness of multi-user whole network throughput, with minimal consideration for network-level user experience. Moreover, existing approaches predominantly concentrate on specific resource domains, seldom considering holistic collaboration across all domains, which limits the user experience of the whole network. This paper introduces an innovative resource allocation method grounded in the Shannon theorem, incorporating time-frequency-spatial domain multi-dimensional collaboration. More importantly, by constructing an optimization model, we strive to attain optimal network-level user experience. Furthermore, we provide a smart grid technology based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) method to predict inter-frequency information, including Received Signal Reference Power (RSRP), beam ID, and spectral efficiency, which are modeled as air interface utilization, channel bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio, respectively, providing input for the optimization algorithm, which seeks to achieve the optimal time-frequency-space resource allocation scheme.

This usually requires the consecutive evaluation of many candidate solutions, which is only feasible for simple path loss models, such as one-slope models or multi-wall models. However, such path loss models are quite straightforward and often do not deliver satisfactory estimations, eventually impacting the quality of the proposed network deployment. More advanced models, such as Indoor Dominant Path Loss models, are usually more accurate, but as their path loss calculation is much more time-consuming, it is no longer possible to evaluate a large set of candidate deployment solutions. Out of necessity, a heuristic network planning algorithm is then typically used, but the outcomes heavily depend on the quality of the heuristic. Therefore, this paper investigates the use of Machine Learning to approximate a complex 5G path loss model. The much lower calculation time allows using this model in a Genetic Algorithm-based network planning algorithm. The Machine Learning model is trained for two buildings and is validated on three other buildings, with a Mean Absolute Error below 3 dB. It is shown that the new approach is able to find a wireless network deployment solution with an equal, or smaller, amount of access points, while still providing the required coverage for at least 99.4% of the receiver locations and it does this 15 times faster. Unlike a heuristic approach, the proposed one also allows accounting for additional design criteria, such as maximal average received power throughout the building, or minimal exposure to radiofrequency signals in certain rooms."",,""This research was funded by the Special Research Fund (BOF-Dutch abbreviations), Belgium, grant number 01W00818, and LACETEL, Cuba."",Applied Sciences,,,,2022-04-13,2022,2022-04-13,,12,8,3923,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Santana, Yosvany Hervis"; Alonso, Rodney Martinez; Nieto, Glauco Guillen; Martens, Luc; Joseph, Wout;" Plets, David"",""Santana, Yosvany Hervis (Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium";, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.); LACETEL, Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, Havana 19210, Cuba;, glauco@lacetel.cu); Alonso, Rodney Martinez (Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.)); Nieto, Glauco Guillen (LACETEL, Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, Havana 19210, Cuba;, glauco@lacetel.cu); Martens, Luc (Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.)); Joseph, Wout (Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.)); Plets, David (Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);", david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.))"",""Santana, Yosvany Hervis (Ghent University"; Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.); LACETEL, Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, Havana 19210, Cuba;", glauco@lacetel.cu)"",""Santana, Yosvany Hervis (Ghent University"; Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.); LACETEL, Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, Havana 19210, Cuba;, glauco@lacetel.cu); Alonso, Rodney Martinez (Ghent University; Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.)); Nieto, Glauco Guillen (LACETEL, Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, Havana 19210, Cuba;, glauco@lacetel.cu); Martens, Luc (Ghent University; Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.)); Joseph, Wout (Ghent University; Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);, david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.)); Plets, David (Ghent University; Departament of Information Technology, Ghent University/IMEC, Technologiepark-Zwijnaarde 126, 9052 Ghent, Belgium;, rodney.martinezalonso@ugent.be, (R.M.A.);, luc1.martens@ugent.be, (L.M.);, wout.joseph@ugent.be, (W.J.);", david.plets@ugent.be, (D.P.))"",21,17,,9.7,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/8/3923/pdf?version=1649847268,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147098770,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Part 1.PRS Signals Configuration,""The evolution of 1G–4G mobile communication networks (MCNs) has shown that network positioning has traditionally been considered as one of the additional features in the process of standardization, construction, and operation of networks, which was in demand when the signals of global navigation satellite systems were unavailable. MCNs were used to determine location mainly in the interests of emergency services and law enforcement. However, the developed MCN infrastructure opened up wide opportunities for determining the location of devices. Therefore, in the process of evolution, starting with analog 1G MCNs, positioning methods were also improved. Digital 2G GSM MCNs contributed to the development of network positioning with an accuracy of tens or hundreds of meters at the request of the regulator. The globalization of MCNs is associated with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for the standardization of 3G universal mobile telecommunications systems. Since the 3G generation, in the process of MCN standardization, the 3GPP specifications began to impose requirements for network location determination. This trend was continued in 4G LTE MCNs and further developed in 5G networks. For 5G networks, in the latest 3GPP specifications, in contrast to MCNs of previous generations, the requirements for positioning accuracy up to one meter are formalized for the first time. At the same time, in addition to the traditional 2G–4G cases of emergency calls, positioning scenarios are presented in public communication networks, both for subscribers and devices: location-based service, positioning in industry and healthcare, traffic control, rail and sea transportation, as well as positioning using unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the ambitious task of positioning with an accuracy of up to one meter, which is approximately an order of magnitude less than in previous MCN generations, 5G networks at the radio interface level use special positioning reference signals (PRS), first proposed in 4G LTE MCNs. The new 5G NR radio interface, unlike the 4G LTE MCNs of previous generations, allows the use of an order of magnitude wider frequency bands in the millimeter-wave range (mmWave), which allows achieving meter positioning accuracy. From the point of view of collecting and processing primary measurements, the positioning accuracy is determined, first of all, by the signals used. Using the built-in functions of the 5G Toolbox extension package of the special Matlab software allows visualizing the PRS signal configuration procedures in the time-frequency domain of the 5G NR radio interface. The first part of the study considers 5G NR network positioning technology modeling and formalizes the PRS signal configuration procedures used to collect primary measurements. Simulation modeling of procedures for secondary processing of primary measurements with the resulting estimate of the coordinates of 5G NR devices is the subject of research in the second part. The result of this work is the substantiation of the problem of achieving meter accuracy of device positioning in networks of the fifth and subsequent generations, as well as setting the task of the secondary processing of primary measurements using configured PRS signals."",,,Proceedings of Telecommunication Universities,,,,2022-06-30,2022,2022-06-30,,8,2,48-63,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Fokin, G."",""Fokin, G.

In total ten rooftop sites were chosen to measure various types with different covers and construction variants. Considering the rooftop attenuation in the EMF-assessment can reduce the compliance boundary in vertical dimension of cellular sites with 4G or 5G NR radio systems, as the public area is typically below the rooftop. For precise measurement of the rooftop attenuation a measurement methodology is presented, which uses existing mobile radio signals. The measured rooftop attenuation values range from 12dB to 40dB for frequencies between 816MHz and 3654MHz including 4G and 5G and are dependent on the concrete thickness and rooftop cover. In addition, measurements of larger openings such as dome rooflights, which can decrease the rooftop attenuation in worst-case scenarios to nearly zero dB, are presented."",""The authors thank Deutsche Funkturm GmbH for granting access to the rooftop sites.

We estimate uplink and downlink interference from a single interferer and a network of interferers in New York City, using real three-dimensional (3D) building data and realistic antenna patterns. We perform detailed ray-tracing propagation simulations, for locations of the MetOp-B weather satellite and its scanning orientations and ground interferer antenna orientations for representative urban cell sites. In addition to the ITU-R threshold of –136 dBm/200 MHz, we propose an alternative set of harmful interference thresholds directly related to the sensitivity of the satellite sensor. Our results show that the 3GPP power leakage limits are sufficient to ensure that interference from a single 5G device is not harmful if considering the ITU-R threshold, but not if the weather prediction software can tolerate only very low interference levels. Importantly, aggregate interference resulting in practice from a 5G network with realistic network densities is often harmful, even considering the least conservative ITU-R threshold. Overall, our comprehensive coexistence study thus strongly suggests that additional engineering and/or regulatory solutions will be necessary to protect weather satellite passive sensing from mm-wave cellular network interference."",,,IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking,,,,2023-07-26,2023,2023-07-26,2023-12-01,9,6,1546-1560,All OA";" Green,Article,""Palade, Andreea"; Voicu, Andra M.; Mähönen, Petri;" Simić, Ljiljana"",""Palade, Andreea (Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, 52072, Aachen, Germany)"; Voicu, Andra M.

However, it also provides a new foundation for the CTC (covert timing channel), which transmits data in a hidden way. Because the packet type, transmission sequence, and transmission jitter in VoLTE have the strong regularity, it is challenging to build CTC. In this paper, a CTC construction method based on zigzag matrix named ZM-CTC is proposed to establish a connection between the codewords and dropped packets in a nonlinear rule. Moreover, a random salt and a random field in VoLTE are introduced to enhance the undetectability of ZM-CTC. The experimental results show that the ZM-CTC with 9 bits codeword could keep a balance among the undetectability, the robustness, the throughput, and the construction cost. The throughput of CTC is 0.88 bps, and the bit error rate of CTC is less than 1.5%."",""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62072037, U1936218), and in part by Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing Universities of Civil Engineering and Architecture, China (No. X20069)."",,Computer Communications,,,,2022-01,2022,,2022-01,182,,212-222,Closed,Article,""Zheng, Jiamin"; Li, Shupan; Hao, Shengang; Li, Yuanzhang;" Zhang, Yu"",""Zheng, Jiamin (School of E-Business and Logistics, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China)"; Li, Shupan (School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, ZhengZhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Hao, Shengang (School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China); Li, Yuanzhang (School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China);" Zhang, Yu (School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Beijing, China)"",""Li, Shupan (Zhengzhou University)"",""Zheng, Jiamin (Beijing Technology and Business University)"; Li, Shupan (Zhengzhou University); Hao, Shengang (Beijing Institute of Technology); Li, Yuanzhang (Beijing Institute of Technology);" Zhang, Yu (Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture)"",7,4,,3.65,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142352388,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To this end, this paper focuses on the need to solve the problem of the poor bandwidth of the vehicle–ground integration information network, and proposes a vehicle–ground integration information network scheme for EMUs based on small base stations. Based on the existing wi-fi system of the EMU, in order to realize the coverage of the 5G signal in the carriage, this paper—through the deployment of the technical characteristics of 5G—sinks the customized UPF (user plane function) and MEC (mobile edge computing) to the train carriage, and expands the internet channels of the train carriage. Relying on the technologies of MEC and CDN (content delivery network) for high-speed railways, network extension service products can satisfy passengers’ needs around network rate and delay. On the one hand, this can relieve the pressure of the network backhaul and save the bandwidth resources of the vehicle–ground integration information network. On the other hand, it can help operators to reduce the investment of network construction, operation, and maintenance. As a result, the proposed scheme can inspire the products that match the extended service needs of the passenger, realize the technical and innovation value of the 5G mobile network, and achieve business model innovation in high-speed mobile scenarios."",,This research was funded by the Science and Technology Project of China Railway (P2021G011).,Electronics,,,,2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,,11,12,1824,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Dong, Xingzhi"; Li, Ping; Yu, Qirui;" Zhu, Yuhao"",""Dong, Xingzhi (Postgraduate Department, China Academy of Railway Science, Beijing 100081, China";, dongxingzhi2021@163.com, (X.D.);, zhuyuhao1994@outlook.com, (Y.Z.)); Li, Ping (China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, 13700009804@126.com); Yu, Qirui (China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing 100081, China;, 13700009804@126.com); Zhu, Yuhao (Postgraduate Department, China Academy of Railway Science, Beijing 100081, China;, dongxingzhi2021@163.com, (X.D.);", zhuyuhao1994@outlook.com, (Y.Z.))"",""Li, Ping (China Academy of Railway Sciences)"",""Dong, Xingzhi (China Academy of Railway Sciences)"; Li, Ping (China Academy of Railway Sciences); Yu, Qirui (China Academy of Railway Sciences);" Zhu, Yuhao (China Academy of Railway Sciences)"",1,1,,0.52,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/12/1824/pdf?version=1654751200,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148589038,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"611,pub.1153671283,10.1109/tim.2022.3229710,,,Design of a Compact RF Front-End Transceiver Module for 5G New-Radio Applications,""This article presents a new transceiver configuration based on the low-noise power amplifier (LNPA) approach targeting the reduction in size and the overall biasing complexity. In such configuration, the LNPA remains always at the ON state and the single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) switches control the conversion between transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) modes. Different from the conventional configuration, the switching speed depends solely on the SPDT switches avoiding the settling time of the amplifiers. To ensure the stable operation of the LNPA under such condition, an over-the-air (OTA) durability test of the transceiver module is proposed for the first time. No obvious degradation was observed when the module was tested by switching between Tx and Rx modes every 30 s for 14 h of continuous operation. At 38 GHz, the 1-m OTA measurement using a standard 64-QAM fifth-generation (5G) new-radio (NR) modulated signal exhibited an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 4.52% at an output power of 18.38 dBm in the Tx mode. The noise figure (NF) in the Rx mode was measured to be 7.07 dB. The experimental results are comparable to the state-of-the-art transceivers in single-chip solutions. It is believed that the proposed transceiver based on the LNPA configuration has great potential as the building block of the large-scale phased-array systems for 5G NR applications."",""The authors would like to thank the Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute (TSRI), Hsinchu, Taiwan for the fabrication of chips and measurement."",""This work was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan, under Grant NSTC 111-2927-I-A49-505, Grant NSTC 111-2634-F-A49-008, Grant NSTC 111-2218-E-A49-021, Grant NSTC 111-2221-E-A49-187, Grant NSTC 111-2811-E-A49-529, and Grant NSTC 111-2622-8-A49-018-SB";" and in part by the “Center for the Semiconductor Technology Research” through The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project of the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan."",IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,,,,2022-12-15,2022,2022-12-15,2023-01-01,72,,1-9,Closed,Article,""Wang, Yuan"; Hsu, Heng-Tung; Desai, Arpan;" Tsao, Yi-Fan"",""Wang, Yuan (International College of Semiconductor Technology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 30010, Taiwan)"; Hsu, Heng-Tung (International College of Semiconductor Technology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 30010, Taiwan); Desai, Arpan (International College of Semiconductor Technology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 30010, Taiwan);" Tsao, Yi-Fan (International College of Semiconductor Technology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 30010, Taiwan)"",""Tsao, Yi-Fan (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University)"",""Wang, Yuan (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University)"; Hsu, Heng-Tung (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University); Desai, Arpan (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University);" Tsao, Yi-Fan (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University)"",12,12,,5.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153671283,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The remote monitoring system is mainly a network system with convenient layout, simple maintenance, and high security performance built on the basis of the wireless network, which can realize real-time monitoring, and collects transmit information. It is mostly used in remote monitoring of room temperature, remote monitoring of intelligent furniture, engineering construction, and teaching. Communication technology dominates the operation of remote monitoring systems. With the introduction of 5G technology, mobile Internet technology has been pushed to the top of technology again. Using 5G mobile communication technology in the monitoring system, people can observe or operate the monitored things at any time. The sensor is an indispensable component of the remote monitoring system, and a new type of optical fiber is added to the sensor to make the system function more complete. However, the related technology is not very mature, and the research on remote monitoring system is relatively backward in China. Relevant studies have found that when the remaining energy of the information node in the remote monitoring system reaches 10%, the information node will die and the speed of information transmission will decrease.

This is because power amplifier (PA) is a key building block in the design of fifth generation (5G) communication systems. A significant trend is the DPA bandwidth enhancement technique, which is the subject of numerous papers in the literature. So, we will review some papers with different solutions to address DPA's bandwidth limitations. There are also different works in the literature that have focused on high‐efficiency PA structure designs, which are also discussed in this paper. An excellent option for effective power combining in broadband designs is using balanced amplifiers. We have discussed load modulated balanced amplifiers (LMBA) in this paper because designing an effective PA with a wide bandwidth is crucial. We also covered some papers that have proposed techniques based on the linearization method to bring the efficiency and linearity of DPAs to a fair level."",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no potential conflict of interests.,,International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications,,,,2023-01-09,2023,2023-01-09,2023-05,51,5,2422-2445,Closed,Article,""Makhsuci, Saeedeh"; Navidi, Seyedeh Masoumeh; Sanduleanu, Mihai;" Ismail, Mohammed"",""Makhsuci, Saeedeh (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, DetroitMichigan, USA)"; Navidi, Seyedeh Masoumeh (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, DetroitMichigan, USA); Sanduleanu, Mihai (Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE);" Ismail, Mohammed (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, DetroitMichigan, USA)"",""Makhsuci, Saeedeh (Wayne State University)"",""Makhsuci, Saeedeh (Wayne State University)"; Navidi, Seyedeh Masoumeh (Wayne State University); Sanduleanu, Mihai (Khalifa University of Science and Technology);" Ismail, Mohammed (Wayne State University)"",10,10,,6.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154357822,""40 Engineering";" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Node positioning technology is an important support for 5G sensors, so it has been a hot research direction in recent years. This article has carried on the basic discussion to the speech broadcasting technology, and introduced the speech broadcasting coding in many aspects, including the development history, the current situation and the compression coding algorithm. This article has launched a basic analysis and discussion on the voice broadcast algorithm, such as its basic principles and classification. In order to minimize the property losses and casualties caused by urban fires and improve the efficiency and success rate of urban fire emergency systems, it is necessary to be able to query fire information in a timely and effective manner and formulate emergency protection. As we all know, China’s current economic development is in a period of steady improvement, and the process of urbanization is gradually accelerating, especially the number of high-rise and super high-rise buildings has increased significantly. Therefore, once a city fire occurs, it will not only cause huge losses of property, but also may cause a large number of casualties. Although the current fire protection system in Chinese cities is relatively complete, there are still some problems that have not been resolved in actual work, such as insufficient technical equipment and insufficient response speed in some areas due to economic constraints. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish an efficient urban fire emergency information system, not only to be able to query fire information in a timely and effective manner, but also to be able to formulate emergency support plans for specific actual situations."",,,Journal of Computational Methods in Sciences and Engineering,,,,2023-05-30,2023,,,23,3,1363-1380,Closed,Article,""Huang, Ying"; Dong, Gang; Liu, Zhangyin; Zhu, Jiong;" Peng, Weidong"",""Huang, Ying (State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd., Jiaxing Power Supply Company, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China)"; Dong, Gang (State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd., Jiaxing Power Supply Company, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China); Liu, Zhangyin (State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd., Jiaxing Power Supply Company, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China); Zhu, Jiong (State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd., Jiaxing Power Supply Company, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China);" Peng, Weidong (State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd., Jiaxing Power Supply Company, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, China)"",""Huang, Ying (State Grid Corporation of China (China))"",""Huang, Ying (State Grid Corporation of China (China))"; Dong, Gang (State Grid Corporation of China (China)); Liu, Zhangyin (State Grid Corporation of China (China)); Zhu, Jiong (State Grid Corporation of China (China));" Peng, Weidong (State Grid Corporation of China (China))"",2,2,,1.45,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155014268,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Satisfactory performance of the communications over the mmWave spectrum requires an alignment between the signal beam of the transmitter and receiver, achieved via beam training protocols. Nevertheless, beam training is vulnerable to jamming attacks, where the attacker intends to send jamming signals over different spatial directions to confuse legitimate nodes. This paper focuses on defending against this attack in smart factories where a moving Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) communicates with a base station via a mmWave carrier. We introduce a defensive strategy to cope with jamming attacks, including two stages: jamming detection and jamming mitigation. Developed based on autoencoders, both algorithms can learn the characteristics/features of the received signals at the AGV. They can be employed consecutively before performing the downlink data transmission. In particular, once a jamming attack is identified, the jamming mitigation can be utilized to retrieve the corrupted received signal strength vector, allowing a better decision during the beam training operation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is straightforward and fully compliant with the existing beam training protocols in 5G New Radio. The numerical results show that not only the proposed defensive strategy can capture more than 80% of attack events, but it also improves the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio significantly, i.e., up to 15 dB."",,""This work was supported in part by the Warwick Manufacturing Group Centre High Value Manufacturing Catapult, The University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."",IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-04-06,2023-01-01,18,,2204-2217,All OA";" Green,Article,""Dinh-Van, Son"; Hoang, Tiep M.; Cebecioglu, Berna Bulut; Fowler, Daniel S.; Mo, Yuen Kwan;" Higgins, Matthew D."",""Dinh-Van, Son (Warwick Manufacturing Group, School of Engineering, The University of Warwick, CV4 7AL, Coventry, U.K)"; Hoang, Tiep M.

This paper presents the performance analysis of a GFDM system over the FTR fading environment. In this analysis, both GFDM and space–time coded (STC) GFDM system has been considered, and an exact closed-form expression of the average symbol error rate (ASER) is derived for the μ -QAM modulation technique under imperfect channel estimation condition.

The paper designed and completed an eight-port dual-polarized high-efficiency shared-radiator antenna working in 3.5 GHz (3.4–3.6 GHz) for 5G mobile devices. The two antenna elements are regarded as one building block and share one radiator, and the size of one radiator is 17.1 × 17.1 mm2 (0.02 λ × 0.02 λ, where λ presents the free-space wavelength at 3.5 GHz). The MIMO system consists of four radiators, and the edge-to-edge distance between the radiators on the short side is 31.9 mm (0.038 λ), and the total size of the MIMO antenna system is 150 × 80 × 1.6 mm3 (0.176 λ × 0.094 λ × 0.0019 λ). The antenna uses an orthogonal placement of feed lines to produce dual polarization in the MIMO system, resulting in high isolation without introducing other decoupling structures. In addition, the reason for the high efficiency of the antenna is explained by the common mode (CM) and differential model (DM). Finally, the simulated results are as follows: the isolation is 14 dB"; the total efficiency (TE) is 75–85%; the envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) is lower than 0.065;" and the gain is 6.5 dB. The prototype is fabricated and tested: the isolation is better than 17 dB, the range of the measured TE is 60–75%, and the ECC is lower than 0.045. In addition, the influence of the human body model on the antenna are also discussed. Overall, the proposed MIMO antenna has a shared radiator with high isolation and high TE, and is more suitable for the current stage of 5G MIMO antenna technology. More importantly, the planar structure block is very simple to build and easy to fabricate on the substrate."",,""This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51965047), the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (Grant No. 2021MS06012) and the Key Scientific and Technological Project of Inner Mongolia (Grant No. 2020GG0185)."",Electronics,,,,2022-05-20,2022,2022-05-20,,11,10,1628,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Shao, Rui"; Chen, Xiaomin; Wang, Junlin;" Wang, Xin"",""Shao, Rui (College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010021, China)"; Chen, Xiaomin (College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010021, China); Wang, Junlin (College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010021, China);" Wang, Xin (College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010021, China)"",""Wang, Junlin (Inner Mongolia University)";" Wang, Xin (Inner Mongolia University)"",""Shao, Rui (Inner Mongolia University)"; Chen, Xiaomin (Inner Mongolia University); Wang, Junlin (Inner Mongolia University);" Wang, Xin (Inner Mongolia University)"",7,6,,3.04,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/10/1628/pdf?version=1653017686,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148049966,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",7 Affordable and Clean Energy";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The novelty of the DAI framework is that it is implemented in an autonomous, dynamic and flexible fashion, utilising Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agents, extended with ML capabilities, which reside on the mobile devices (User Equipment). We refer to these as BDIx agents. This provides a component-based framework (likened to LEGO-based building blocks), which can build on and utilise execution plans, by composing and arranging ML techniques in flexible ways within the framework, in order to achieve the desired goals. More specifically, we form a modular BDIx agent at a multi-agent system (MAS), integrated with Fuzzy Logic for the perception/cognitive part of the agents. By exploiting the capabilities of the BDIx agents in our DAI framework, we allow mobile devices to intercommunicate and cooperate in an autonomous manner, thus offering a number of attractive features, including improved performance in terms of network control execution time and message exchange, fast response in handling dynamic aspects in the network, self-organising network functionalities, and a framework that can act as the glue platform in employing one or more intelligent approaches to tackle the diverse 5G/6G technical requirements. To demonstrate the potential of the DAI framework we focus on Device to Device (D2D) communication and illustrate its flexibility in addressing diverse D2D challenges. Through example Plan Libraries and enhanced metrics, we outline DAI implementation specifics to achieve a number of identified 5G/6G D2D requirements. To embed the concept further, the specific problem of D2D transmission mode selection is expanded upon, from problem description to solution approach (DAIS) and implementation specifics, and hence comparatively evaluate over other approaches (i.e., Unsupervised learning ML techniques, centralised control techniques, random techniques). The results demonstrated that DAIS provides, among other performance metrics, improved mobile network Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Power Consumption (PC), better and more efficient cluster formation and reduced control decision delay."",""This research is part of a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement N o 739578 and the government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development .

However, this deployment creates an interference scenario";" mainly, the problem occurs severely from the users of the connected and autonomous vehicle in MeNBs coverage to HeNBs coverage. The main reason is that deploying HeNBs in MeNBs applies the co-subchannels by HeNB and MeNB, leading to severe cross-tier interference (CSI) in the OFDMA subcarrier. Due to this CSI occurrence, the spectral efficiency, Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), and system outages affect severely. As a result, the MeNB User Equipment (MUEs) and HeNB User Equipment (HUEs) suffer from service disruption, and the entire system’s performance degrades. This challenge has attracted the attention of many researchers and the telecom industries. As a result, several interferences controlling methods such as enhanced frequency allocation strategies, power management, control technique, resource scheduling, spectrum sharing, and Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques have been suggested for 5G communications. However, the study suggests that downlink interference is still challenging in dense urban zones, especially in multilevel and high-rise complex buildings. This paper proposes the EBBDSA-CSI technique where a novel Evolutionary Biogeography-based Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation (EBBDSA) algorithm is introduced for reducing the cross-tier Subcarriers interference (CSI) issues in MeNB and HeNB. The system-level simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm reduces the system outage to 88.1%, and total spectral efficiency achieves 83.6% compared to the existing techniques."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Especially for underwater mines in the fault zone, surrounding rock instability and water inrush are the main threats to mining safely and efficiently. This paper briefly reviews the research progress and development trend of deformation law and failure mechanism of jointed rock mass specimens, multi-field coupling numerical simulation method of rock mass with faults, prevention of water inrush. Geological tectonic movement and rock mass excavation destroy the integrity and continuity of rock, break the in-situ stress field of rock mass, and lead to weak structural planes such as joints, cracks, and faults. The stress and strain properties of rock mass reflects the mechanical effects of rock mass and joints comprehensively. The physical, chemical, and stress environments of rock masses in deep mines are more complex. The mechanism of rock failure and water inrush disaster under the coupling effect of THMC multiple fields is worth further research.

Every year, the amount of data transmitted from things and people on the Internet is approximately two zettabytes. The volume of data on the Internet is constantly growing. According to the Internet Live Stats service, more than 50,000 search queries are made on Google every second, 120,000 videos are viewed on YouTube, and almost 2.5 million e-mails are sent. Therefore, it is expedient to implement the fifth generation of communication, which will work in the millimeter range. Promising technologies for building 5G and its implementation include small base stations, which are analogs of conventional mobile network base stations. Within settlements, small base stations should be located short distances from each other (approximately 250 meters). From such parameters, it can be concluded that it will be necessary to use thousands of such stations to cover even a small city, forming a single network that will transmit data to 5G users. Among the advantages, it can be noted that due to the small size of the antennas, they can be placed on any elements of structures and buildings (for example, on the walls of buildings, pillars, etc.) without additional obstacles.

The seven indicators of impact factor, total publications, average publication year, total/average citations, and total/average normative citations were selected to analyze the selected articles by country, institution, journal, keywords, and highly cited literature. Three major research themes of existing building energy efficiency are obtained by analyzing the quantitative results of keywords and highly cited literature: (1) influencing factors and energy-saving obstacles of energy consumption, (2) energy-saving measures, and (3) energy-saving optimization and its evaluation method. Finally, based on the bibliometric results, this research qualitatively analyzes the highly cited literature and the latest research results to obtain the future development trends and possible directions of energy conservation in the existing buildings throughout their life cycle. This study provides innovative ideas for the energy-saving renovation of existing buildings: (1) Technology empowerment (using renewable energy, negative carbon technology, “artificial intelligence + Internet of Things + 5G” and cogeneration, etc.) and (2) Formulating regulations and policy incentives for different decision-makers (implementing demand response strategies such as time-of-use pricing to guide and restrict user behavior, considering carbon tax and carbon trading, etc.). on the premise of utilizing renewable energy and increasing the capacity resilience of the distribution grids, the existing buildings will be energy-efficient, economical, intelligent and comfortable in the future."",""We gratefully acknowledge the funding support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 52067004 and 72104062], in part by the Key Laboratory of “Internet+” Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing in Guizhou Provence [grant number 20165103] and Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [grant number 21YJC630041]."",,Energy Reports,,,,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,8,,13170-13188,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Huang, He"; Wang, Honglei; Hu, Yu-Jie; Li, Chengjiang;" Wang, Xiaolin"",""Huang, He (School of Management, Guizhou University, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China)"; Wang, Honglei (School of Management, Guizhou University, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China; Key Laboratory of “Internet+” Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing in Guizhou Provence, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China); Hu, Yu-Jie (School of Management, Guizhou University, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China; Research Centre for Karst Region Development Strategy, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China); Li, Chengjiang (School of Management, Guizhou University, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China; School of Engineering, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, 7005, Australia);" Wang, Xiaolin (School of Engineering, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, 7005, Australia)"",""Wang, Honglei (Guizhou University";" Key Laboratory of “Internet+” Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing in Guizhou Provence, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China)"",""Huang, He (Guizhou University)"; Wang, Honglei (Guizhou University; Key Laboratory of “Internet+” Collaborative Intelligent Manufacturing in Guizhou Provence, Guiyang Guizhou 550025, China); Hu, Yu-Jie (Guizhou University; Guizhou University); Li, Chengjiang (Guizhou University; University of Tasmania);" Wang, Xiaolin (University of Tasmania)"",35,35,,22.24,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2022.10.023,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151942832,33 Built Environment and Design"; 3302 Building; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, most surgeons still perform surgical training using the traditional autopsy and prosthesis model, which encounters many problems, such as insufficient corpse resources, low efficiency, and high cost. With the advent of the 5G era, a wide range of Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) applications have been developed. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies that emerged with 5G are developing rapidly for intelligent medical training. To address the challenges encountered during neurosurgery training, and combining with cloud computing, in this paper, a highly immersive AR-based brain tumor neurosurgery remote collaborative virtual surgery training system is developed, in which a VR simulator is embedded. The system enables real-time remote surgery training interaction through 5G transmission. Six experts and 18 novices were invited to participate in the experiment to verify the system. Subsequently, the two simulators were evaluated using face and construction validation methods. The results obtained by training the novices 50 times were further analyzed using the Learning Curve-Cumulative Sum (LC-CUSUM) evaluation method to validate the effectiveness of the two simulators. The results of the face and content validation demonstrated that the AR simulator in the system was superior to the VR simulator in terms of vision and scene authenticity, and had a better effect on the improvement of surgical skills. Moreover, the surgical training scheme proposed in this paper is effective, and the remote collaborative training effect of the system is ideal."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

"591,pub.1154973140,10.1109/tetci.2023.3234564,,,Construction of Polar Codes Based on Memetic Algorithm,""As an emerging coding technique chosen by the 5th generation wireless systems (5G) standardization process, polar coding has attracted the attention of both academia and industry in recent years. The currently used construction methods of polar code are generally based on the reliability of each polarized sub-channel, which directly correspond to the Successive Cancellation (SC) decoding algorithm. However, much less is known about the optimal construction of polar codes under more sophisticated decoding methods such as the Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding. There is currently no perfect theory to derive the optimal construction for the SCL decoding to the best of our knowledge, because finding such optimal construction of SCL is considered to be a hard problem for normal choices of the list size. To address this problem, in this paper we turn to evolutionary computation, and propose a memetic algorithm by incorporating prior knowledge obtained from both the channel estimation of the SC-profile and the codeword weight evaluation of the RM-profile, shorted as MA-SCRM. The potential constructions of polar codes are expressed as binary sequences which are processed as the individuals of the population in MA-SCRM. Based on the prior knowledge obtained from the SC-profile and the Reed-Muller-profile, we design special initialization and evolutional operators for polar codes construction. An elitism archive is also introduced to maintain promising constructions and accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. For the SCL decoding, MA-SCRM obtains polar-coding constructions that are more excellent than the SC decoder construction in the sense of block error probability. Compared with the SC decoding construction method, MA-SCRM can reduce the block error probability by up to 48.78 for the original block error rate around $10^{-2}$, and more improvement can be observed for lower original block error rate."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, under Grant 2022YFF1202104, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, under Grants 62001300, 61871272, and 61976143, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China, under Grants 2021A1515011679 and 2021A1515011911, in part by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation, under Grant 2022A1515010139, in part by the Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program, under Grants JCYJ20190808173617147, 20200811181752003, and JCYJ20220531102617039, and in part by the Open Project of BGIShenzhen, under Grant BGIRSZ20200002."",IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence,,,,2023-01-30,2023,2023-01-30,,7,5,1539-1553,Closed,Article,""Liu, Ling"; Yuan, Wenhao; Liang, Zhengping; Ma, Xiaoliang;" Zhu, Zexuan"",""Liu, Ling (College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China)"; Yuan, Wenhao (College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China); Liang, Zhengping (College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China); Ma, Xiaoliang (College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China); Zhu, Zexuan (National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China; Shenzhen Pengcheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, 518055, China;" BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518083, China)"",""Zhu, Zexuan (Shenzhen University"; Peng Cheng Laboratory;" BGI Group (China))"",""Liu, Ling (Shenzhen University)"; Yuan, Wenhao (Shenzhen University); Liang, Zhengping (Shenzhen University); Ma, Xiaoliang (Shenzhen University); Zhu, Zexuan (Shenzhen University; Peng Cheng Laboratory;" BGI Group (China))"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154973140,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"591,pub.1147053340,10.1007/s00500-022-07046-3,,,Prediction of thawing settlement coefficient of frozen soil using 5G communication,""This paper presents a decision support system for prediction of frozen soil thaw settlement coefficient to solve the possible thaw settlement problems affecting slope stability, which leads to rock pile section roadbed deformation, and threaten road safety. For this purpose, the prediction of frozen soil thawing settlement coefficient is decided using 5G communication. The prediction is constructed using MIMO-D2D system, increases the signal transmission dimension, improves the system throughput, and effectively allocates resources, which solves the problem of interference coordination between device-to-device (D2D) and cellular users in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. A set of equipment pieces for in situ thawing tests of coarse-grained and giant-grain frozen soil is designed. Field tests are carried out to obtain the thawing coefficient of the frozen soil and calculate the thawing compression index, which can evaluate the influence of frozen soil thawing settlement on railway engineering. The experimental results of the research show that the elastic properties of frozen soil are weak, the unloading rebound is only 10% of the compression amount, and the rebound is concentrated in a short time. The experimental results show that the thaw settlement coefficient of frozen soil is 0.67%, which is classified as Class I according to thaw settlement, non-thaw settlement, and weak thaw settlement. The maximum thaw settlement at the slope of the tunnel entrance section is about 6.7 cm, which allows settlement after construction."",,This paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (42077269) and National Kye Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC1501301).,Soft Computing,,,,2022-04-12,2022,2022-04-12,2022-10,26,20,10837-10852,Closed,Article,""Yin, Yueming"; Wei, Chaoqun; Wang, Haichao; Wang, Zhenghong;" Deng, Qinglu"",""Yin, Yueming (China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China)"; Wei, Chaoqun (China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China); Wang, Haichao (China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China); Wang, Zhenghong (China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China);" Deng, Qinglu (China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China)"",""Deng, Qinglu (China University of Geosciences)"",""Yin, Yueming (China University of Geosciences)"; Wei, Chaoqun (China University of Geosciences); Wang, Haichao (China University of Geosciences); Wang, Zhenghong (China University of Geosciences);" Deng, Qinglu (China University of Geosciences)"",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147053340,46 Information and Computing Sciences,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An E-shaped patch antenna placed on an electromagnetic bandgap ground (EBGG) with operating bandwidth of 24.2–27.5 GHz is used as the basic building block of the eight-element linear array. The array utilizes both the in-phase reflection characteristic for broad element radiation pattern and the bandgap characteristic for mutual coupling reduction for limited inter-element spacing of the proposed array. The existence of the EBGG enables a compact array with the inter-element spacing of around 0.4 wavelengths at the center frequency, yet the isolation between each element is still above 17 dB within the whole band of interest, which also helps to increase the array directivity at large scanning angles. The scanning angle of the array with the electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure ranges from −75° to 75° at 26 GHz within 3 dB scanning loss. The proposed EBGG extends the antenna array’s spatial coverage and enables a compact size of the array, which is very attractive for 5G millimeter-wave (mm-wave) application."",,This work was supported in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi under Grant 2020ZDLGY15-03 and in part by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program under Grant JSGG20210802153800002.,IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,,,,2022-04-07,2022,2022-04-07,2022-08-01,70,8,7264-7269,Closed,Article,""Zhao, Luyu"; He, Yuqi; Zhao, Ge; Chen, Xiaoming; Huang, Guan-Long;" Lin, Wei"",""Zhao, Luyu (National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, Shaanxi, China)"; He, Yuqi (National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, Shaanxi, China); Zhao, Ge (National Key Laboratory of Antennas and Microwave Technology, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, Shaanxi, China); Chen, Xiaoming (School of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an, 710049, China); Huang, Guan-Long (School of AI-Guangdong & Taiwan, Foshan University, Foshan, 528225, Guangdong, China);" Lin, Wei (Global Big Data Technologies Center, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia)"",""Chen, Xiaoming (Xi'an Jiaotong University)"",""Zhao, Luyu (Xidian University)"; He, Yuqi (Xidian University); Zhao, Ge (Xidian University); Chen, Xiaoming (Xi'an Jiaotong University); Huang, Guan-Long (Foshan University);" Lin, Wei (University of Technology Sydney)"",44,37,,19.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146963510,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Each chip includes two variable-gain frequency-conversion channels and can support two simultaneous independent beams, and the chips also integrate a local-oscillator chain and digital module for multi-chip extension and gain-state control. To improve the radio-frequency performance, several circuit-level improvement techniques are proposed for the key building blocks in the front-end system. Furthermore, an advanced low-temperature co-fired ceramic process is developed to package the 39 GHz dual-channel transceiver chipset, and it achieves low packaging loss and high isolation between the two transmitting (TX)/receiving (RX) channels. Both the chip-level and system-in-package (SIP)-level measurements are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the transceiver chipset. The measurement characteristics show that the TX SIP provides 11 dB maximum gain and 10 dBm saturated output power, while the RX SIP achieves 52 dB maximum gain, 5.4 dB noise figure, and 7.2 dBm output 1 dB compression point. Single-channel communication link testing of the transceiver exhibits an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 3.72% and a spectral efficiency of 3.25 bit·s−1·Hz−1 for 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation and an EVM of 3.76% and spectral efficiency of 3.90 bit·s−1·Hz−1 for 256-QAM modulation over a 1 m distance. Based on the chipset, a 39 GHz multi-beam prototype is also developed to perform the MIMO operation for 5G millimetre wave applications. The over-the-air communication link for one- and two-stream transmission indicates that the multi-beam prototype can cover a 5–150 m distance with comparable throughput."",""Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (62171102 and 61931007), and in part by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFB1805003).

For problems related to planning or forecasting future events, or where there is some uncertainty in the available data, R-number uses a certain percentage of risk and error as a confidence factor for such data, eliminating discrepancies between available data and determined values. Given its advantages and flexibility, this study aims to propose an R-number multi-attributive real–ideal comparative analysis (RN-MARICA) method suitable for using in multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM). In this regard, firstly, this study defines the Aczel–Alsina operation for R-numbers. Based on this, the R-number Aczel–Alsina operators were created, namely R-number Aczel–Alsina weighted geometric averaging (RNAAWGA) operator, R-number Aczel–Alsina ordered weighted geometric averaging (RNAAOWGA) operator, and R-number Aczel–Alsina hybrid weighted geometric averaging (RNAAHWGA) operator, and their related properties were studied. Secondly, based on the R-number Aczel–Alsina operators, the multi-attributive real–ideal comparative analysis (MARICA) method is extended to the R-number MAGDM environment, which is called the RN-MARICA method. Finally, this study applies the proposed RN-MARICA method to the risk analysis of 5G base station project construction, proving the feasibility and applicability of the proposed framework."",,""Funding was provided by Shanxi “1331 Project” Key Innovative Research Team, and “The Discipline Group Construction Plan for Serving Industries Innovation”, Shanxi, China: The Discipline Group Program of Intelligent Logistics Management for Serving Industries Innovation."",International Journal of Fuzzy Systems,,,,2022-11-29,2022,2022-11-29,2023-03,25,2,684-714,Closed,Article,""Cheng, Rui"; Fan, Jianping;" Wu, Meiqin"",""Cheng, Rui (School of Economics and Management, Shanxi University, 030006, Taiyuan, China)"; Fan, Jianping (School of Economics and Management, Shanxi University, 030006, Taiyuan, China);" Wu, Meiqin (School of Economics and Management, Shanxi University, 030006, Taiyuan, China)"",""Wu, Meiqin (Shanxi University)"",""Cheng, Rui (Shanxi University)"; Fan, Jianping (Shanxi University);" Wu, Meiqin (Shanxi University)"",6,6,,2.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153206434,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The industry has more than 12 million employers with over 250 million employees and creates almost $1.9 trillion worth of structures yearly. Civil construction remains the main driver of growth in China. Basically, a task is developed to meet market demands or demands in a timely fashion. Different possibilities may be thought about in the conceptual drawing board, and also the technical and also financial feasibility of each alternative will be assessed and compared in order to select the very best feasible job. The construction industry in China is forecast to grow by 7.7% in 2021, driven by strong Y-o-Y growth in the first quarter, reflecting the comparison to the previous year's period when construction work was halted across most of the country. Thereafter, the construction industry is expected to record an average annual growth of 4.2% between 2022 and 2025. The industry's growth over the forecast period is expected to be driven by investments on new infrastructure, including investment in the areas of 5G networks, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and data centers. According to the government-backed think tank, the China Electronic Information Industry Development, the country is expected to spend CNY10 trillion (US$1.4 trillion) on new infrastructure projects between 2020 and 2025. This study evaluated factors affecting construction sector performance: explanatory factor analysis evidence from China. From the literature reviewed, it was established that entering the Chinese construction market is still seen as exciting but difficult by many foreign contractors and consultants. The study found out that rising material and labor costs, labor woes, increased competition and shrinking profit margins were some of the challenges construction firms in Chin face. The study concludes that the implementation of construction safety laws and the rate of subcontracting are relevant factors affecting construction sector in China, while neither the extent of using temporary workers, nor the availability of resources, nor the level of per capita GDP has any effects.

From mobile Internet, to IoT, and then to the smart connection of everything, 6G will transform from 5G’s service objects of people and things to the intelligent networking of agent that supports human–machine–object. 6G networks should have the characteristics of ubiquitous intelligence and ubiquitous perception, which poses challenges for 6G network construction. Therefore, we propose a 6G Semantic Communication Scheme based on Intelligent Fabrics for transportation in-cabin scenarios (6GSCS-IF), which can provide senseless intelligent interaction in transportation in-cabin environment through widely and flexibly deployed intelligent fabrics, demonstrating the superiority of intelligent fabrics in realizing human–machine–object intelligent sensory interaction. Then, we propose a Deep Learning-based Semantic Communication Model for Time-series data (DL-SCMT), and use deep learning for semantic sensing and information extraction to build an end-to-end semantic communication system. The experimental results show that the semantic communication services provided by this model can achieve better signal reconstruction and higher-order intelligent services compared with traditional communication methods."",,This work was supported in part by the China National Natural Science Foundation under Grant 62176101 and in part by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province under Grant 2021A0505110008.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2022-06-03,2022,2022-06-03,2023-01-01,24,1,1153-1162,Closed,Article,""Tang, Yuan"; Zhou, Ning; Yu, Qiao; Wu, Di; Hou, Chong; Tao, Guangming;" Chen, Min"",""Tang, Yuan (School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China)"; Zhou, Ning (Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China); Yu, Qiao (School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China); Wu, Di (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing, Guangzhou, 510006, China); Hou, Chong (Sport and Health Initiative, Optical Valley Laboratory, the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, and the School of Optics and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China); Tao, Guangming (Sport and Health Initiative, Optical Valley Laboratory, the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, and the State Key Laboratory of Material Processing and Die & Mould Technology, School of Materials Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China); Chen, Min (School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China;" Sport and Health Initiative, Optical Valley Laboratory and Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China)"",""Chen, Min (Huazhong University of Science and Technology";" Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics)"",""Tang, Yuan (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)"; Zhou, Ning (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Yu, Qiao (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Wu, Di (Sun Yat-sen University; Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province); Hou, Chong (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Tao, Guangming (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Chen, Min (Huazhong University of Science and Technology;" Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics)"",15,15,,6.6,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148415797,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While UAV flying base stations have been used in emergency events in 5G networking (sporadic and temporary), their use will significantly increase in 6G networking, as 6G expects reliable connectivity even in rural regions and requires high-performance communication channels and line-of-sight channels for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Securing the integrity and availability of the base station operations is critical because of the users’ increasing reliance on the connectivity provided by the base stations, e.g., the mobile user loses connectivity if the base station operation gets disrupted. This paper identifies the security issues and research gaps of flying base stations, focusing on their unique properties, while building on the existing research in wireless communications for stationary ground base stations and embedded control for UAV drones. More specifically, the flying base station’s user-dependent positioning, its battery-constrained power, and the dynamic and distributed operations cause vulnerabilities that are distinct from those in 5G and previous-generation mobile networking with stationary ground base stations. This paper reviews the relevant security research from the perspectives of communications (mobile computing, 5G networking, and distributed computing) and embedded/control systems (UAV vehicular positioning and battery control) and then identifies the security gaps and new issues emerging for flying base stations. Through this review paper, we inform readers of flying base station research, development, and standardization for future mobile and 6G networking."",,""This work was supported by an Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No.2021-0-00796, Research on Foundational Technologies for 6G Autonomous Security-by-Design to Guarantee Constant Quality of Security)."",Future Internet,,,,2023-05-09,2023,2023-05-09,,15,5,176,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Chang, Sang-Yoon"; Park, Kyungmin; Kim, Jonghyun;" Kim, Jinoh"",""Chang, Sang-Yoon (Computer Science Department, University of Colorado Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918, USA)"; Park, Kyungmin (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea;, kmpark@etri.re.kr, (K.P.);, jhk@etri.re.kr, (J.K.)); Kim, Jonghyun (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon 34129, Republic of Korea;, kmpark@etri.re.kr, (K.P.);, jhk@etri.re.kr, (J.K.)); Kim, Jinoh (Computer Science Department, Texas A&M University-Commerce, Commerce, TX 75428, USA;", jinoh.kim@tamuc.edu)"",""Chang, Sang-Yoon (University of Colorado Colorado Springs)"",""Chang, Sang-Yoon (University of Colorado Colorado Springs)"; Park, Kyungmin (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute); Kim, Jonghyun (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute);" Kim, Jinoh (Texas A&M University – Commerce)"",10,10,,8.37,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/15/5/176/pdf?version=1683622484,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157931525,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The purpose of the work is to review and comparative analysis of multiple access technologies for promising mobile communication networks, which are based on OFDM. Result: The general principles of signal generation and processing when using variants of signals with OFDM using various methods of digital filtering of subcarrier frequencies are considered. For those OFDM options where a cyclic prefix may not be used (FBMC, UFMC), the possibility of increasing the information transfer rate is controversial, since the impulse responses of filters, for example, with FBMC, significantly exceed the duration of information signals, which increases intersymbol interference. Practical significance: The analysis of the general principles for constructing devices for generating and processing physical layer signals for OFDM variants with various methods of additional digital filtering of subcarrier frequencies shows that in all cases there is a significant complication of digital algorithms for generating and processing signals with a practical absence or in some cases a small gain (not more than (0.5&0.8) dB in relation to signal/noise) by the magnitude of the error per information bit. Based on the results of computer simulation, it is shown that OFDM technology and its variants do not allow obtaining breakthrough solutions in the field of physical layer signal characteristics for 5G and 6G networks, and alternative options for building group signal structures should be considered."",,,H&ES Research,,,,2022,2022,2022,2022,14,2,19-26,All OA";" Gold,Article,""GORGADZE, SVETLANA F.";" ERMAKOVA, ANASTASIA V."",""GORGADZE, SVETLANA F.

"582,pub.1167437158,10.1109/tnsm.2023.3348137,,,Revamping the Resilience and High Availability of 5G Core for 6G Ready Network Slices,""Current advancements in the design of the service-based architecture of 5G Core (5GC) are flexible to be deployed with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in the form of network slices. While some slices tolerate the delay and some do not, this versatility of slice services imposes challenges to Mobile Network Operators in designing a robust, scalable, and yet resilient 5GC. Therefore, in this work, we build a self-resilient 5GC that not only addresses the scheduling requirements per slice type but also yields service satisfaction. Precisely, we build it as a combination of large Integer Linear Programming based Column Generation (CG) and Artificial Intelligence based Deep Learning in a Closed Loop Automation with a Self Organizing Network paradigm. During unexpected situations of overload and failures of serving instances, the proposed CG technique in the work improves the scheduling and serving of control plane user requests by dropping 15% lesser user requests in delay-tolerant slices and 5% lesser in delay-sensitive slices, than the existing state-of-the-art solutions. With 95% learning accuracy, the Deep Learning-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method predicts the availability of serving instances of the Network Functions (NFs) of the 5GC. Overall, by deriving the optimal number of serving instances for each NF of the 5GC, this blend of CG and AI in the 5GC not only contributes to efficient scaling and reconfiguration of the slices but also improves the resilience and High Availability of the 5GC. We believe that this proposed work is a highly promising solution for building Cognitive Autonomous Networks (CAN) of core side slices for upcoming Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G in both cloud and edge deployments."",,,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,,,,2023-12-29,2023,2023-12-29,2024-04-01,21,2,2287-2302,Closed,Article,""Vittal, Shwetha"; Sarkar, Sourav;" Franklin, A.

The behavior of wireless signal propagation depends on several variables, such as frequency, building height, elevation angle, and street design. This paper aims to compare the three established line of sight (LOS) probability model based on actual site data, including the building geometry in suburban environment. The comparison between these three models using the site data provide a guideline for selecting the LOS probability model based on the optimistic and pessimistic predictions. The shadowing loss was evaluated at frequencies 2 and 3.5 GHz with an elevation angle of 20° in two suburban locations at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. Three prediction models, ITU-R P.1410-5, Holis and Pechac, and Pang et al., available in the literature were used to identify and compare the line-of-sight probability. By focusing on the shadowing model in suburban area, the guideline for optimizing LOS communications or navigation in these challenging environments can be developed. The finding highlights the importance of considering building height in AG communication for network performance evaluation and design."",,,International Journal of Microwave and Wireless Technologies,,,,2023-12-15,2023,2023-12-15,2024-03,16,2,339-347,Closed,Article,""Seah, Shi Jie"; Jong, Siat Ling; Yin Lam, Hong;" Leow, Chee Yen"",""Seah, Shi Jie ()"; Jong, Siat Ling (); Yin Lam, Hong ();" Leow, Chee Yen ()"",,""Seah, Shi Jie ()"; Jong, Siat Ling (); Yin Lam, Hong ();" Leow, Chee Yen ()"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167073685,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Compared with 5G, 6G is envisioned to achieve a much higher performance and experience a number of paradigm shifts, such as exploiting new spectrum, applying ubiquitous Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) technologies and building a space-air-ground-sea integrated network. However, these paradigm shifts may lead to numerous new security and privacy issues, that traditional security measures may not be able to address. Moreover, the expected high performance of 6G also challenges network reliability and energy efficiency. To tackle these issues and build a trustworthy 6G network, we introduce a novel trust framework called SIX-Trust. This framework is composed of three layers with an emphasis on distinct aspects: sustainable trust (S-Trust), with a particular focus on trust in applications of AI, novel trust evaluation methods and modeling of trust relationships"; infrastructure trust (I-Trust), which is more focused on the trustworthiness of network infrastructure;" and xenogenesis trust (X-Trust) paying special attention to the core technologies which form the backbone of 6G trust. Besides, the importance of each layer varies under different application scenarios of 6G. For each layer, we briefly introduce its related enabling technologies, and demonstrate how these technologies can be applied to enhance the trust and security of the 6G network. Finally, a use case is illustrated and analyzed. In general, SIX-Trust provides a holistic framework for defining and modeling trust in 6G, which can facilitate establishment of a trustworthy 6G network."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-10-02,2023-01-01,11,,107657-107668,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Wang, Yiying"; Kang, Xin; Li, Tieyan; Wang, Haiguang; Chu, Cheng-Kang;" Lei, Zhongding"",""Wang, Yiying (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588)"; Kang, Xin (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588); Li, Tieyan (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588); Wang, Haiguang (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588); Chu, Cheng-Kang (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588);" Lei, Zhongding (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588)"",""Kang, Xin (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588)"",""Wang, Yiying (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588)"; Kang, Xin (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588); Li, Tieyan (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588); Wang, Haiguang (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588); Chu, Cheng-Kang (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588);" Lei, Zhongding (Digital Identity and Trustworthiness Laboratory, Huawei Singapore Research Center, Singapore, Singapore, 138588)"",17,17,,13.84,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10268440.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164651935,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An exceptional study is being conducted by network design and optimization experts. But despite this, the constantly changing network environment continues to provide new issues that today’s networks must be dealt with effectively. Increased capacity and coverage are achieved by joining existing networks. Mobility management, according to the researchers, is now being investigated in order to make the previous paradigm more flexible, user-centered, and service-centric. Additionally, 5G networks provide higher availability, extremely high capacity, increased stability, and improved connection, in addition to quicker speeds and less latency. In addition to being able to fulfil stringent application requirements, the network infrastructure must be more dynamic and adaptive than ever before. Network slicing may be able to meet the present stringent application requirements for network design, if done correctly. The current study makes use of sophisticated fuzzy logic to create algorithms for mobility and traffic management that are as flexible as possible while yet maintaining high performance. Ultimately, the purpose of this research is to improve the quality of service provided by current mobility management systems while also optimizing the use of available network resources. Building SDN (Software-Defined Networking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) technologies is essential. Network slicing is an architectural framework for 5G networks that is intended to accommodate a variety of different networks. In order to fully meet the needs of various use cases on the network, network slicing is becoming more important due to the increasing demand for data rates, bandwidth capacity, and low latency."",""Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

In this study, we review four types of elevation angle-dependent probability of line-of-sight (LoS) expressions according to building distribution types. With channel characterization data extracted from the ray tracing (RT) simulation, LoS probability versus elevation angle agrees better with the elevation angle-dependent probability expressions of LoS that assumes the buildings are randomly distributed. Furthermore, we provide a more accurate LoS probability expression that enables better curve-fitting for the LoS probability data obtained from RT simulations. In addition, the A2G channel parameters such as LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel path loss exponents (PLEs) and the shadow fading with UAV altitudes are obtained in four typical and realistic urban environments. The LoS PLEs increase slowly with the height of the UAV, while the NLoS one decreases significantly with the increase of the UAV height."",,""The work of Mengan Song and Zhonghua Liang was supported in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Project in Shaanxi Province of China under Grant 2020JM-242 and Grant 2021JM-185, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871314.

It uses 5G wireless networking technology to transmit monitoring data to a cloud server for early warning of abnormal changes and development trends. Real-time monitoring data obtained in a construction site are used as the inputs of the finite element model and the corresponding results of numerical simulation are compared with the results from the real-time monitoring. It can be concluded that: (1) the stress caused by environmental temperature is very significant which can be higher than the initial prestress of the steel assembly bracing"; (2) the stress caused by the vertical vibration mainly from construction vehicles is not remarkable, however, the vertical frequency-weighted acceleration of support vibration is relatively large which can affect the sense of safety of engineering technicians on site;" (3) the combination of the environmental temperature and vertical vibration does not affect the safety of the steel assembly bracing."",,""This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, grant number LGG20E080002."",Buildings,,,,2023-02-06,2023,2023-02-06,,13,2,450,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Yang, Yingwu"; Zeng, Hangbin; Liu, Xingxi; Yang, Bo;" Li, Ying"",""Yang, Yingwu (College of Landscape and Architecture, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou 311300, China)"; Zeng, Hangbin (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Liu, Xingxi (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China); Yang, Bo (School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou 310018, China);" Li, Ying (Zhejiang Province Institute of Architectural Design and Research, Hangzhou 310006, China)"",""Yang, Bo (Zhejiang Sci-Tech University)";" Li, Ying (Zhejiang Province Institute of Architectural Design and Research)"",""Yang, Yingwu (Zhejiang A&F University)"; Zeng, Hangbin (Zhejiang Sci-Tech University); Liu, Xingxi (Zhejiang Sci-Tech University); Yang, Bo (Zhejiang Sci-Tech University);" Li, Ying (Zhejiang Province Institute of Architectural Design and Research)"",5,5,,2.84,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/13/2/450/pdf?version=1676277878,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155209463,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is a promising technology in 5G communications. The polar code is the only channel coding technology that can theoretically achieve Shannon limit transmission, which make it the preferred coding technology in cooperative communication. In this paper, we proposed a new wireless communication scheme, which is a polar coded cooperative spatial modulation schemes based on Plotkin construction and Quasi-uniform puncturing (QUP). First, we adopt Plotkin construction based on the inverted codeword of the polar code to get a cooperation method, which offer a significant improvement in performance on the polar code cooperation under fading channels. We analyze the decoding characteristics of the inverted codewords and then introduces the QUP method to improve the cooperation benefits. At the same time, we extend the cooperation scheme with differential spatial modulation for the proposed coded cooperative schemes. The new coded-cooperation scheme outperforms its coded non-cooperative counterpart schemes under identical conditions, as expected. Monte Carlo simulated results show that the proposed cooperative schemes outperform their corresponding non-cooperative counterpart schemes, by the gain of 2.5 dB with 1024 code length and 0.25 code rate under identical conditions."",,""This work is supported by the Beibu Gulf University Foundation project(2017KYQD124) from Guangxi Province, China."",Wireless Personal Communications,,,,2023-02-22,2023,2023-02-22,2023-03,129,2,1407-1423,All OA";" Green,Article,""Zeng, Jiangli";" Lu, Weiyan"",""Zeng, Jiangli (College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, No. 29, Jiangjun Road, Jiangning District, 21006, Nanjing, China)";" Lu, Weiyan (College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beibu Gulf University, Binhai Avenue, No.12 Binhai New City, 535011, Qinzhou, China)"",""Zeng, Jiangli (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)"",""Zeng, Jiangli (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)";" Lu, Weiyan (Beibu Gulf University)"",3,3,,2.55,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-307320/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155635903,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the development of 5G technology, the communication bandwidth is increasing, the coverage of the base station is getting smaller and smaller, and the types and signal coverage characteristics of base stations are also different. Therefore, the problem of site selection and planning of base stations in cities begins to become more prominent. Based on the principle of priority business volume and the cost performance of base station, this paper establishes a set of models to solve the site selection planning problem of urban base station.

However, the lack of consideration for building security in extreme weather conditions, especially in hot and overheated conditions, which propose a requirements for synergistic design of fire resistance and optical selectivity of materials. Herein, this work propose to introduce the compound (PAC) originated from phytic acid (PA) and cytosine (C) and the LDH nanosheets modified by ammonium polyphosphate (APP) into porous cellulose acetate (CA) film to obtain synergistically functionalized 2D/3D cellulose LDH photonic films (CPA films). The presence of substantial amounts of P elements effectively enhances the fire resistance of films, so that it burns without an open flame and with excellent self-extinguishing. Furthermore, the P=O and P−O in APP and PAC endows CPA films with outstanding atmospheric window emissivity via selective absorption, whose infrared emissivity is 93.68%. Meanwhile, the modified dispersive LDH increases solar radiation reflectivity to 96.15%. As a verification, building models covered with films are constructed, cooling of 6℃ be achieved and average energy saving efficiency is 22.8% through shading roof merely. Looking forward to the future, the CPA films will get a comprehensive application in buildings, 5G communication base stations, spacecraft and all equipment exposed to solar.Graphical abstract"",""This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52173158, 32171725), the Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20200107) and the facility support from of the Big Data Computing Center of Southeast University."",,Fibers and Polymers,,,,2023-06-09,2023,2023-06-09,2023-06,24,6,1951-1961,Closed,Article,""Shi, Shengnan"; Feng, Shuangjiang; Liu, Chenghuan; He, Man; Bu, Xiaohai; Zhang, Zewu; Zhou, Yuming;" Yao, Qingzhao"",""Shi, Shengnan (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, 211189, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China)"; Feng, Shuangjiang (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, 211189, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China); Liu, Chenghuan (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, 211189, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China); He, Man (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, 211189, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China); Bu, Xiaohai (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Institute of Technology, 211167, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China); Zhang, Zewu (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanjing Institute of Technology, 211167, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China); Zhou, Yuming (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, 211189, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China);" Yao, Qingzhao (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, 211189, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China)"",""Zhou, Yuming (Southeast University)";" Yao, Qingzhao (Southeast University)"",""Shi, Shengnan (Southeast University)"; Feng, Shuangjiang (Southeast University); Liu, Chenghuan (Southeast University); He, Man (Southeast University); Bu, Xiaohai (Nanjing Institute of Technology); Zhang, Zewu (Nanjing Institute of Technology); Zhou, Yuming (Southeast University);" Yao, Qingzhao (Southeast University)"",2,2,,0.48,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159412349,40 Engineering"; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we have reported the effects of different symmetric shaped slots on millimeter-wave patch antenna design and its performance at 10 GHz frequency in the X band (8-12 GHZ). The rectangular, circular, and elliptical slots area is kept constant at 11.2 mm2. The radius of circular and spherical slots is the same. High-frequency simulation software (HFSS) simulation results in parameters like S11 (reflection coefficient), Y-parameter (driving point admittance), Radiation Pattern, 3D Polar plot and illustrate that the results are in good agreement with the desired value. A rectangular slot is found to achieve the target resonance frequency with a low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) towards a ‘good match.’ Circular, spherical, and elliptical-shaped slots have high VSWR values, indicating a larger degree of mismatch. Surprisingly, results are obtained for the spherical-shaped slot, implying that the antenna will work at the target resonance frequency and has a Dual-Resonance.

The even and odd modes of the coplanar waveguide (CPW) constructions, respectively, activate the monopole and Vivaldi antennas, which make up the suggested antenna. Additionally, gain is increased while back radiation and edge effects are reduced by using the defected ground structure (DGS). By varying the excitation amplitude and phase of the two ports, the proposed antenna can operate in four different modes: mode 1 (omnidirectional), mode 2 (broadside), mode 3 (left titled) and mode 4 (right titled). The entire dimension is $0.667\mathbf {\mathrm {\lambda }} _{0} \mathbf {\times } 0.500\mathbf {\mathrm {\lambda }} _{0} \mathbf {\times } 0.007\mathbf {\mathrm {\lambda }} _{0}$ (where $\mathbf {\mathrm {\lambda }} _{0}$ is the free space wavelength at 2 GHz).

GSHPs provide a higher performance over the alternative conventional Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) systems, and have seen an increased interest with the continuous energy price increase and the need for lowering the CO2 emissions to meet the European Union “Fit for 55” targets. The high initial capital required for the GSHP systems in the residential sector is the main preventive factor for the GSHP systems. Recent studies revealed that with the nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) EU derivative in effect, the residential dwellings are built with a higher insulation on the building’s envelop and therefore with a lower heating and cooling demand";" hence the potential payback period of such systems is increased.Geothermal energy District Heating (DH) on the other hand could make these systems more viable with the advantage of lower carbon emissions, lower maintenance and a lower cost, but at the moment the infrastructure and availability are mainly present in central and northern Europe, where a higher heating demand is required compared to the southern EU. Having a central unit for distribution however, requires a large plant area, and of course the need for infrastructure and insulated pipes. An alternative to these solutions could be the use of SGE systems at a micro scale level.To this extent, this research aims to computationally investigate the possibility and potential of SGE systems for a micro-scale urban environment. A theoretical case study is developed, with the inclusion of residential blocks categorized as “islands” for the production, use and distribution of SGE as a form of 5th generation (5G) DH and Cooling (DHC) with Mediterranean climate in the island of Cyprus. The case study includes either multiple multi-story residential buildings with nZEB characteristics or multiple detached residential buildings within a residential block, typical for the island of Cyprus. The heating and cooling demands, as well as the peak loads are estimated and the Ground Loop Design (GLD) software is used to size the required vertical Ground Heat Exchangers (GHEs) with different configurations. The effect of the unbalanced ground temperature and the temperature gain/ loss from the heat distribution is examined with the use of COMSOL Multiphysics software. Results indicate a potential advantage of the use of GSHP systems at a residential use micro-scale in terms of costs reduction and promotion of the geothermal energy use."",,,,,,,2023-05-15,2023,2023-05-15,,,,,Closed,Article,""Aresti, Lazaros"; Makarounas, Christos; Florides, Georgios; Onoufriou, Toula;" Christodoulides, Paul"",""Aresti, Lazaros ()"; Makarounas, Christos (); Florides, Georgios (); Onoufriou, Toula ();" Christodoulides, Paul ()"",,""Aresti, Lazaros ()"; Makarounas, Christos (); Florides, Georgios (); Onoufriou, Toula ();" Christodoulides, Paul ()"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155750725,33 Built Environment and Design"; 3302 Building,13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we propose a scheme of through-wall wireless communication by applying purposely designed passive metalenses for an asymmetric background medium of the wall. An ultrathin metalens consisting of three layers of metallic patterns is applied to focus the incoming waves to the other side of the wall with high efficiency. The focusing effect is verified by scanning the spatial distribution of electric fields. Due to the focusing effect, the wireless signal strength is significantly enhanced while propagating through the wall. To validate its use in the 5-GHz Wi-Fi environment, we demonstrate that the metalens can reconnect a network channel that is otherwise broken due to weak signal strength, and thus, significantly increase the data transmission rate.

Often development relates improvements for data transmission rate and latency improvements on radio interface. When building new telecommunications standards where network and mobile station can communicate together irrespective of manufacturer, there is need for standardization where various technical features construct standard specifications. There is investigated whether LTE Carrier Aggregation commercial deployment intentions have happened in early phase after standard specifications for equipment implementation have been ready. The results show that LTE Carrier Aggregation has adopted to commercial usage immediately after standard specifications have been ready for implementation. LTE Carrier Aggregation is also basis for development path towards 5G technology.   Purpose: The objective of this research was to investigate LTE Carrier Aggregation commercial deployment and how soon it happened after standardization finalization. Because LTE Carrier Aggregation feature was expected to be important feature there is good reason to expect its deployment for real commercial markets.   Design/Methodology/Approach: Used methodology was to gather network operators’ and equipment manufacturers’ intentions for LTE Carrier Aggregation commercial deployment purposes during and after standardization finalization. Information found from public sources where commercial deployment intentions launched by companies.       Findings: The research showed that after and already before standardization finalized there were immediate intentions for LTE Carrier Aggregation deployment. Commercial trials appeared within one year and real commercial deployments appeared within two years from standardization finalization. That means soon deployments in commercial markets when considering deployment in licensed band.   Research, Practical & Social implications: For future works there could be study why not LTE Carrier Aggregation solutions in unlicensed band was not successful and whether there be will changes when going to 5G standard deployment.   Originality/Value: This article is an academic contribution for innovation feature commercial deployment in telecommunications industry and investigation whether LTE Carrier Aggregation feature deployment happened as soon as expected.   Key Words: LTE Carrier Aggregation, Standardization, Deployment, 5G technology."",,,International Journal of Professional Business Review,,,,2022-08-12,2022,2022-08-12,,7,2,e0354-e0354,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Hussa, Timo"",""Hussa, Timo (University of Vaasa)"",,""Hussa, Timo (University of Vaasa)"",0,0,,0.0,https://www.openaccessojs.com/JBReview/article/download/354/209,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150256728,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, under unstable wireless channel conditions, existing WFL schemes exist the following challenges: First, learning model parameters will be disturbed by bit errors because of interference and noise during wireless transmission, which will affect the training accuracy and the loss of the learning model. Second, traditional edge devices with CPU acceleration are inefficient due to the low throughout computation, especially in accelerating the encoding and decoding process during wireless transmission. Third, current hardware-level GPU acceleration methods cannot optimize complex operations, for instance, complex wireless coding in the WFL environment. To address the above challenges, we propose a software-defined GPU-CPU empowered efficient WFL architecture with embedding LDPC communication coding. Specifically, we embed wireless channel coding into the server weight aggregation and the client local training process respectively to resist interruptions in the learning process and design a GPU-CPU acceleration scheme for this architecture. The experimental results show its anti-interference ability and GPU-CPU acceleration ability during wireless transmission, which is 10 times the error control capability and 100 times faster than existing WFL schemes."",""Therefore, the authors gratefully acknowledge technical and financial support from the Ministry of Education and King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."",This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant 23K11072"; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U21B2019 and Grant 61972255; and in part by the Institutional Fund Projects under Grant IFPIP: 50-830-1443.,IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-04-12,2023-01-01,4,,990-1000,All OA;" Gold,Article,""Li, Zihong"; Hong, Yang; Bashir, Ali Kashif; Al-Otaibi, Yasser D.;" Wu, Jun"",""Li, Zihong (Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, 808, Japan)"; Hong, Yang (Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, 808, Japan); Bashir, Ali Kashif (Department of Computing and Mathematics, Manchester Metropolitan University, M15 6BH, Manchester, U.K; Woxsen School of Business, Woxsen University, Hyderabad, 502345, India); Al-Otaibi, Yasser D.

The key feature of IAB is multi-hop wireless backhauling, allowing utilizing relaying IAB-nodes to provide cost-efficient access network densification and alleviate the problem of blockages. One of the critical performance measures in such systems is the latency of packet delivery over the multi-hop paths. The paper aims at assessing the impact of multi-hop transmission on the end-to-end delay in an IAB radio access network, taking into account the half-duplex constraint. We build a detailed queuing theory model for latency assessment in time-division-multiplexing (TDM)-based IAB deployments and evaluate the delay due to queuing in the network nodes for several cell topologies and under different time allocation strategies between access and backhaul. The paper considers a practical Manhattan-style urban deployment, which is characteristically impaired by the blockage of buildings. The numerical results show that balancing the access and backhaul micro phases is crucial for reducing the end-to-end packet delay, at least in the uplink, while increasing the number of network hops yields a linear increase in the total packet delay for both the uplink and downlink.

However, while operating collaboratively, ensuring the ML model's security and data privacy is challenging. To this end, this article proposes a secure and privacy-preservation on-demand framework for building attack-detection ML models for 5GB vehicular networks. The proposed framework emerged from combining 5GB technologies, namely, Federated Learning (FL), blockchain, and smart contracts to ensure fair and trusted interactions between FL servers (edge nodes) with FL workers (vehicles). Moreover, it also provides an efficient consensus algorithm with an intelligent incentive mechanism to select the best FL workers that deliver highly accurate local ML models.

Besides other possible application areas they hold the commitment to numerous new nano-scale solutions in the biomedical field. Nano-technology, as the name implies, examines the construction and design of nano-sized materials. These two interconnected emerging technologies have the potential to find application in quite many areas, one of the most importan being healthcare. This overview paper discusses the specifics of these technologies, their most important characteristics and introduces some of the trends for their application in the healthcare sector. In the first section terahertz frequency radio waves and their specific properties depending on the surrounding environment are discussed, followed by an introduction to nano-scale communications. Terahertz waves mandate the use of nano-scale antennas, which in turn brings us to the concept of nano-scale nodes. Nano-scale nodes are units that can perform the most basic functions of nano-machines and inter-nano-machine communications, which allow distributed nano-machines to perform more complex functions. Beyond 5G the development of these nano-communications is expected to lead to the emergence of new complex network systems. In the second part of this paper the paradigms of the Internet of Nano Things, molecular commnications and the Internet of Bio-Nano Things are discussed followed by details on their integration in healthcare related applications. The main goal of the article is to provide an introduction to these intriguing issues discussing advanced nano-technology enablers for Beyond 5G networks such as terahertz and molecular communications, nano-communications between nano-machines and the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things in light of health related applications."",,No funding was received.,Wireless Personal Communications,,,,2022-06-22,2022,2022-06-22,2022-10,126,4,3543-3568,Closed,Article,""Akkaş, Mustafa Alper";" Sokullu, Radosveta"",""Akkaş, Mustafa Alper (Department of Computer Engineering, Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey)";" Sokullu, Radosveta (Deptartment of Electrcal and Electronic Engineering, Ege University, Bornova, Turkey)"",""Akkaş, Mustafa Alper (Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal University)"",""Akkaş, Mustafa Alper (Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal University)";" Sokullu, Radosveta (Ege University)"",7,6,,3.64,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148871328,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The basis of smart technologies is the integration of wireless channel standards with mobile and computer protocols. 4G/5G technologies are integrated with various web platforms, taking into account the digitalization of services in cyberspace. But the SSL/TLS protocol, based on the hybridization of symmetric encryption algorithms with hashing algorithms (AEAD mode), which is supposed to provide security services, is vulnerable to “Meet in the middle”, POODLE, BEAST, CRIME, BREACH attacks. In addition, with the advent of a full-scale quantum computer, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography algorithms that provide security services can also be hacked. To increase the level of security, an improved protocol based on post-quantum algorithms – crypto-code constructions is proposed, which will ensure not only resistance to current attacks, but also stability in the post-quantum period. To ensure the “hybridity” of services, it is proposed to use the McEliece and Niederreiter crypto-code constructions (confidentiality and integrity are ensured) and the improved UMAC algorithm on the McEliece crypto-code construction. Taking into account the level of “secrecy” of information, it is suggested to use various combinations of crypto-code constructions on different algebraic geometric and/or flawed codes. The use of crypto-code constructions not only provides resistance to attacks, but also simplifies the formation of a connection – the parameters of elliptic curves are used to transmit a common key.

Statistical models with slope-intercept fit fall short in capturing large variations seen in urban canyons, whereas ray tracing, capable of characterizing site-specific features, faces challenges in describing foliage and street clutter and associated reflection/diffraction ray calculation. Machine learning (ML) is promising but faces three key challenges in PL prediction: 1) insufficient measurement data"; 2) lack of extrapolation to new streets;" 3) overwhelmingly complex features/models. We propose an ML-based urban canyon PL prediction model based on extensive 28 GHz measurements from Manhattan where street clutters are modeled via a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud dataset and buildings by a mesh-grid building dataset. We extract expert knowledge-driven street clutter features from the point cloud and aggressively compress the 3-D building information using a convolutional autoencoder. Using a new street-by-street training and testing procedure to improve generalizability, the proposed model using both clutter and building features achieves a prediction error [root-mean-square error (RMSE)] of 4.8 ± 1.1 dB compared to 10.6 ± 4.4 and 6.5 ± 2.0 dB for 3GPP line of sight (LOS) and slope-intercept prediction, respectively, where the standard deviation indicates street-by-street variation. By only using four most influential clutter features, the RMSE of 5.5 ± 1.1 dB is achieved."",,The work of Ankit Gupta was supported in part by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (MANGO) under Grant EP/P009670/1 and in part by the Doctoral Training Program under Grant EP/N509474/1-1963633.

However, the cell planning and physical layer parameter optimization to achieve the wide indoor coverage and low latency, which are important performance in such deployments, remain very important and difficult issues to be solved. Therefore, this paper measures the reference signal received power (RSRP), throughput, and delay performance with the shared extended global platform (sXGP) system following TD-LTE specification employing the 1.9 GHz band with 5 MHz bandwidth in the multi-floor building. We employ the automated guided vehicle (AGV), which enables highly accurate measurements while moving at walking speed. We measure the indoor spatial distribution of the performance under various conditions, such as opening and closing of doors and human blockage. Since the delay performance depends more on the physical layer procedure and parameter settings such as scheduling request (SR) periodicity than on the channel conditions, we evaluate the influence of the SR periodicity on the delay performance, and analyze the physical layer procedure in detail.

Therefore, the analysis of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) shadowing effects behind buildings of different heights becomes particularly important. The shadowing of GSM (900 MHz), UMTS (2100 MHz) and LTE (1800 MHz) technologies was investigated in the urban area. The results are examined by using the log-normal path loss model and four different stochastic equations, specifically: normal, log-normal, Rayleigh, and Nakagami. The results showed that the fluctuations of path losses in the urban area correspond to the model of log-normal path losses. However, path losses for individual buildings do not fit this model. Therefore, stochastic methods were used to analyse shadowing effects. A path loss model based on a differential stochastic equation was proposed. This model includes the following values: free space losses, path losses disturbance due to the shadowing effect, standard deviation σ, and a freely chosen parameter b. This model allows a very accurate estimate of the path losses of the three technologies. A clear correlation was observed between parameter b and standard deviation σ."",,,Advances in Electrical and Electronic Engineering,,,,2022-04-01,2022,2022-04-01,,20,1,15 - 23,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Japertas, Saulius"; Grimaila, Vitas; Jankuniene, Ruta;" Tervydis, Paulius"",""Japertas, Saulius ()"; Grimaila, Vitas (); Jankuniene, Ruta ();" Tervydis, Paulius ()"",,""Japertas, Saulius ()"; Grimaila, Vitas (); Jankuniene, Ruta ();" Tervydis, Paulius ()"",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.15598/aeee.v20i1.4338,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146819054,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Popularizing telemedicine is a perfect method to deal with the epidemic, which can be specified with telediagnosis, teletherapy, and telemonitoring. Since patients in remote districts also long for professional medical services, this paper intends to explore the possibility of building a medical institution to provide telemedicine for patients living in remote areas. Besides, this paper discusses the application of each function and its limitations. Though telemedicine brings more chances for the patients who have a distance to the medical institution, high quality equipment and funds are needed to support the run of telemedicine. However, the implementation of 5G can improve the performance of telemedicine, especially in the latency of telesurgery. Overall, though building a medical station that supports telemedicine is challenging, there are particular populations have demand on it. These results shed light on guiding further exploration of digital updating for medical industry."",,,Highlights in Science Engineering and Technology,,,,2022-12-03,2022,2022-12-03,,23,,235-240,Closed,Article,""Hu, Mengjie"",""Hu, Mengjie ()"",,""Hu, Mengjie ()"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153699930,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the rapid development of the 5G network and communication technology, MR technology has been used on a larger scale in every industry in the future. This study analyzes its use in engineering and non-engineering domains, discussing its benefits and drawbacks. MR can be used for data sharing and efficient communication, assisting workers in understanding and guiding their operation, and facilitating project management. However, its disadvantages include unreal images, delayed tracking, restricted condition for the environment, unsatisfactory user experience, and high costs. In non-engineering fields, MR is mainly applied to simulation, real-time interaction and so on in the military, medical science and education fields. The application of MR technology in engineering fields is mainly about construction, disaster management, and prevention. It enhances the work efficiency for construction by allowing 3D visualization of concealed or complex structure, and timely annotation.

For an arbitrary code length, we first construct a balanced binary tree (BBT) where the root node represents a transmitted codeword, the leaf nodes represent either active bits or frozen bits, and a parent node is related to its child nodes by a length-adaptive $(U+V\mid V)$ operation. Both the encoding and the successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding can be implemented over the constructed coding tree. For code construction, we propose a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-dependent method and two SNR-independent methods, all of which evaluate the reliabilities of leaf nodes and then select the most reliable leaf nodes as the active nodes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed codes can have comparable performance to the 5G polar codes. To reduce the decoding latency, we propose a partitioned successive cancellation (PSC)-based decoding algorithm, which can be implemented over a sub-tree obtained by pruning the coding tree. Numerical results show that the PSC-based decoding can achieve similar performance to the conventional SC-based decoding."",,This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2021YFA1000500) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61971454).,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2023-11-02,2023,2023-11-02,2024-02-01,72,2,665-674,Closed,Article,""Yao, Xinyuanmeng";" Ma, Xiao"",""Yao, Xinyuanmeng (School of Computer Science and Engineering and the Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China)";" Ma, Xiao (School of Computer Science and Engineering and the Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510006, China)"",""Ma, Xiao (Sun Yat-sen University)"",""Yao, Xinyuanmeng (Sun Yat-sen University)";" Ma, Xiao (Sun Yat-sen University)"",4,4,,3.4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165536950,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

UAVs link everything in the modern world, and it is an attractive area for academia to focus on. UAVs are proven to be a boon for the whole world as it provides flying services in critical and medical emergencies. UAVs are futuristic technology that enriches human needs by providing numerous benefits or services to proceed toward the smart world. In UAV‐assisted traditional networks, multiple sensors and flying nodes consume a lot of energy resources, and Fifth Generation (5G)/Beyond 5G enabled devices to excrete high radiations, which may cause damage to our environment as well as our society. So, it is very important to maintain a balance between the environment and modern technologies for a better lifestyle. To maintain this, many steps need to be put further to reduce the energy consumption of nodes, consume fewer data resources, and encourage effective energy‐use techniques. Green UAV‐based fog computing is a promising solution to balance environmental issues and provide energy‐efficient data computation and aerial to ground network communication for building an intelligent world with improved Quality of Services (QoS).

"                  Global efforts such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s post-quantum standardization center on cryptographic primitives like public-key encryption and signature schemes that are secure even in the presence of quantum adversaries. In addition, one must also consider efficient certificate management as new technologies like the Internet of Things and 5G wireless networks rely on them. For example, the IEEE Standard for vehicle-to-vehicle communication depends on implicit certificates. However, the only efficient construction available is over elliptic curves, and hence not quantum-secure. This paper investigates approaches to construct implicit certificate schemes from lattices, employing the NIST Round 3 signature schemes Dilithium and Falcon. We consider emulation of the existing implicit certificate scheme and proceed to more innovative techniques like combining the two schemes or pairing them with encryption. Unfortunately, we encounter problems with each design, due to recurring causes like conflicting secret key and signature sizes, unique sampler requirements and the rigidity of the parameter sets. By explaining each of these issues, this paper will hopefully spark ideas for more successful constructions."",,,The Computer Journal,,,,2022-10-28,2022,2022-10-28,2023-06-19,66,6,1320-1334,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Bindel, Nina";" McCarthy, Sarah"",""Bindel, Nina (SandboxAQ, Palo Alto , CA, USA)";" McCarthy, Sarah (Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, 200 University Ave W , Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada)"",,""Bindel, Nina (SandboxAQ (United States))";" McCarthy, Sarah (University of Waterloo)"",5,5,,2.29,https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxac132,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152330975,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose a dynamic service chain construction based on model predictive control (MPC) to utilize network resources. In the proposed method, the number of data packets in the buffer at each node is modeled as a dynamical system for MPC. Then, we formulate an optimization problem with the predicted amount of traffic injecting into each service chain from users for the dynamical system. In the optimization problem, the transmission route of each service chain, the node where each VNF is placed, and the amount of resources for each VNF are determined simultaneously by using MPC so that the amount of resources allocated to VNFs and the number of VNF migrations are minimized. In addition, the performance of data transmission is also controlled by considering the maximum amount of data packets stored in buffers. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation, and the effectiveness of the proposed method with different parameter values is investigated."",,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,2022-04-01,2022,2022-04-01,2022-04-01,E105.B,4,399-410,Closed,Article,""KUMAZAKI, Masaya"; OGURA, Masaki;" TACHIBANA, Takuji"",""KUMAZAKI, Masaya (University of Fukui)"; OGURA, Masaki (Osaka University);" TACHIBANA, Takuji (University of Fukui)"",,""KUMAZAKI, Masaya (University of Fukui)"; OGURA, Masaki (Osaka University);" TACHIBANA, Takuji (University of Fukui)"",3,0,,1.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141891198,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The antenna employs automobile window film as a substrate, which is a cost-effective, easily accessible, and ultra-thin material. The proposed structure comprises a monopole antenna featuring a circular patch pattern that is fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW). Additionally, the internal ground plane has been modified by grooving both sides to form a rectangular slot antenna construction. As a result, the antenna possesses identical dimensions and is equipped with three ports. The antenna exhibits a frequency range spanning from 3.1-GHz to 10.6-GHz across all three ports. Additionally, the $\vert S_{11}\vert $ at port 1 demonstrates an extensive operating bandwidth of 2.4-GHz to 10.6-GHz with a signal attenuation of less than −10-dB. Consequently, it has the capability to facilitate a diverse range of applications such as ultra-wideband (UWB), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), and 5G.

This paper intends to solve problems in increasing latency and consumption of energy and security after deploying Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers in single cell multi-user network model, and has advocated a strategy of allocating the resources of 5G communication in regards to the protection mechanism for privacy in the environment of edge computing. First of all, solution model for the problem is characterized as a model with time delay and energy consumption. Second, privacy is used to measure the uncertainty of data in order to quantify privacy data while computing the allocation of tasks and facilitate the design of objective function. Finally, the task migration problem of minimizing energy consumption under the limitation of completion time is constructed as a nonlinear 0–1 programming problem.

In smart factories, 5G-based production line monitoring can improve production efficiency and reduce costs, but there are problems with limited monitoring coverage and insufficient wireless spectrum resources, which restricts the application of IIoT in the construction of smart factories. In response to these problems, we propose a hybrid spectrum access mechanism based on Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) cooperative relaying transmission to improve the monitoring coverage and spectrum efficiency. As there are a large number of production lines that need to be monitored in smart factories, it is difficult to realize real-time monitoring of all production lines due to insufficient wireless resources. Therefore, we divide the production lines into high priority and low priority, and introduce cognitive radio technology to increase the number of monitoring production lines. In order to better describe the wireless fading channel environment in the factory, the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) channel is discussed to simulate the real factory environment and the outage probability of the secondary production line data transmission is derived in the proposed mechanism. Compared with the traditional mechanism, the proposed transmission mechanism can ensure the continuity of the secondary transmission, greatly reduce the outage probability of the secondary transmission, and improve the efficiency of the monitoring of the production lines."",,,Computers Materials & Continua,,,,2022-07-25,2022,2022-07-25,2022,73,3,6513-6534,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Zhang, Yinghua"; Cao, Rui; Tian, Lixin; Dai, Rong; Cao, Zhennan;" Feng, Jim"",""Zhang, Yinghua (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China)"; Cao, Rui (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China); Tian, Lixin (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China); Dai, Rong (Dawning Information Industry Chengdu Co., Ltd., Chengdu, 610041, China); Cao, Zhennan (Dawning Information Industry Chengdu Co., Ltd., Chengdu, 610041, China);" Feng, Jim (Amphenol Global Interconnect Systems, San Jose, CA, 95131, US)"",""Zhang, Yinghua (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China)"",""Zhang, Yinghua (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China)"; Cao, Rui (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China); Tian, Lixin (Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd., Beijing, 100193, China); Dai, Rong (Dawning Information Industry Chengdu Co., Ltd., Chengdu, 610041, China); Cao, Zhennan (Dawning Information Industry Chengdu Co., Ltd., Chengdu, 610041, China);" Feng, Jim (Amphenol Global Interconnect Systems, San Jose, CA, 95131, US)"",1,1,,0.46,https://file.techscience.com/ueditor/files/cmc/TSP_CMC-73-3/TSP_CMC_29467/TSP_CMC_29467.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149834016,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software;" 4613 Theory Of Computation,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In these networks, very high indicators of the quality of subscriber service are achieved. However, with the development of cellular technologies and the digital society in general, fundamentally new use cases arise that will require even more improved indicators of the effectiveness of the functioning of cellular communication networks. In this regard, progress does not stand still and the 3GPP organization has developed a plan for the development of cellular networks, improving their characteristics and putting them into operation.

This level of transparency is achieved by using Gallium-doped Zinc Oxides. The array designed and tested is for sub-6GHz 5G and operates at 5.8GHz. This seamless design allows such arrays to be integrated into windows of buildings within the smart city to provide consistent network coverage. The phased array has good gain and scanning characteristics as presented below. We have also included a discussion regarding gain and beam steering capabilities in comparison to similar arrays made of conventional copper and RF substrates. This study presents the comparison of two antenna arrays, one constructed from copper antenna elements (Simulated operational band from 5.67 GHz to 6.62 GHz, 7.6% bandwidth, and gain of 2.18 dBi) and one constructed from GZO antenna elements (Simulated operational band from 2.8 GHz to 10 GHz, 112.5% bandwidth, approximately 8% efficiency, and a gain of −10.87 dBi). Both element designs have a 1.5cm by 1.5cm footprint. The results show that a 4x1 array of GZO elements will increase the gain to 0.34 dBi from a gain of −10.87 dBi of a thin film, GZO antenna element. In addition, over 90% transparency allows window integration without obstructing the view. The techniques described in this article also can be used to integrate such arrays in glasses and other transparent materials for various IoT applications."",,,IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-04-29,2022-01-01,3,,538-548,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Green, Ryan B."; Ding, Kai; Avrutin, Vitaliy; Ozgur, Umit;" Topsakal, Erdem"",""Green, Ryan B.

"531,pub.1158237314,10.34028/iajit/20/3a/1,,,Tree-based Multicast Routing and Channel Assignment for Enhanced Throughout in Emerging Cognitive Radio Networks,""In future multi-hop wireless networks like 5G and B5G, efficient large-scale video sharing and data dissemination are expected to rely heavily on multicast routing and Cognitive Radio (CR) technology. While multicast routing is efficient when the network always has access to the spectrum, the dynamic nature of Primary User (PU) activities, heterogeneous spectrum across the CR Network (CRN), and PU access priority make it challenging to implement efficient multicast routing protocols in CRNs. This paper proposes a hierarchical multicast routing mechanism for multi-hop CRNs that exploits the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) concepts. The proposed multicast routing mechanism consists of tree construction and channel assignment algorithms. The tree-construction algorithm models the network topology as a multicast tree rooted at the CR source and spanning all the CR nodes. Based on the constructed tree, the channel assignment algorithm employs the Probability Of Success (POS) metric to assign channels to the various layers defined by the constructed SPT or MST, ensuring that the most reliable channel is used for the multi-hop multicast transmissions. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the mechanism’s effectiveness, revealing significant improvements in throughput and Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) compared to state-of-the-art protocols under different network conditions. The simulations also show that the SPT-based mechanism outperforms the MST-based mechanism in terms of throughput but has a higher tree construction complexity."",,,The International Arab Journal of Information Technology,,,,2023,2023,2023,2023,20,3A,,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Bany Salameh, Haythem";" Ali, Mustafa"",""Bany Salameh, Haythem ()";" Ali, Mustafa ()"",,""Bany Salameh, Haythem ()";" Ali, Mustafa ()"",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.34028/iajit/20/3a/1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158237314,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

New technologies such as 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) increase environment context (from devices/services), making functionalities available to augment context-aware applications. The result is an increased deployment of context-aware applications to support end-users in everyday activities. However, developing applications in context-aware frameworks involve diverse technologies, so that it traditionally involves software experts. In general, context-aware applications are limited in terms of personalization for end-users. They include configurations to personalize applications, but non-software experts can only change some of these configurations. Nowadays, advances in human–computer interaction provide techniques/metaphors to approach non-software experts. One approach is end-user development (EUD)—a set of activities and development tools that considers non-software experts as application builders. In this paper, we present our analysis of existing EUD approaches for building context-aware applications. We present a literature review of 37 screened papers obtained from research databases. This review aims to identify the methods, techniques, and tools proposed to build context-aware applications. Specifically, we reviewed EUD building techniques and implementations. Building techniques include metaphors/interaction styles proposed for application specification, composition, and testing.

"530,pub.1152037235,10.1109/tcomm.2022.3216040,,,Block Polarization HARQ for Polar-Coded Modulation,""In this paper, we propose a block polarization (BP) scheme as a framework to study polar-coded hybrid automatic repeat request (Polar-HARQ) under bit-interleaved polar-coded modulation (BIPCM). The BP scheme of BIPCM can combine multiple independent polar subcodes to form a longer polar code under the block polarization between polar subcodes. The BP scheme of HARQ further carries out block polarization based on the BP scheme of BIPCM, which can combine multiple transmitted BP schemes of BIPCM together to form a longer polar code. When the underlying channels are non-uniform, such as the polarization effect of high-order modulation will lead to non-uniform reliabilities, it is not suitable to use the fixed sequence (e.g., the polarization weight (PW) sequence or Polar sequence in the 5G standard) to construct polar codes. The underlying channels on each polar subcode have uniform reliability by dividing different blocks according to the reliabilities of the underlying channel. Based on this characteristic of BP scheme, we propose a rate-allocation (RA) method to study fast code construction of BP scheme. The key idea of the proposed RA method is finding out the equivalent channel whose average symmetric capacity equals the target transmission rate. The allocated rates are computed according to the symmetric capacities of split channels under the block polarization between polar subcodes. Then the ranking of bit indices within each polar subcode can be obtained by fixed sequence. In this way, the RA code construction is concise and robust for diverse configurations which are the desired features for practical implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed BP scheme under RA construction can achieve almost identical performance as the Gaussian approximation construction with much lower complexity."",,""This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 92067202, Grant 62071058, Grant 62001049 and the Major Key Project of Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL2021A15)."",IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2022-10-19,2022,2022-10-19,2022-12-01,70,12,7802-7816,Closed,Article,""Wang, Wei"; Dai, Jincheng;" Niu, Kai"",""Wang, Wei (Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"; Dai, Jincheng (Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China);" Niu, Kai (Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"",""Niu, Kai (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Wang, Wei (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"; Dai, Jincheng (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);" Niu, Kai (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152037235,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To cater to these requirements various technologies are available such as Multiple Access Technology (MAT), Multiple Input Multiple Output technology (MIMO), Millimetre (mm) wave technology, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Technology (NOMA), Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT). Of all available technologies, mmWave is prominent as it provides favorable opportunities for 5G. Millimeter-wave is capable of providing a high data rate i.e., 10 Gbit/sec. Also, a tremendous amount of raw bandwidth is available i.e., around 250 GHz, which is an attractive characteristic of the mmWave band to relieve mobile data traffic congestion in the low frequency band. It has a high frequency i.e., 30 – 300 GHz, giving very high speed. It has a very short wavelength i.e., 1-10mm, because of this it provides the compact size of the component. It will provide a throughput of up to 20 Gbps. It has narrow beams and will increase security and reduce interference. When the main beam of the transmitter and receiver are not aligned properly there is a problem in ideal communication. To solve this problem beam management is one of the solutions to form a strong communication link between transmitter and receiver. This paper aims to address challenges in beam management and proposes a framework for realization. Towards the same, the paper initially introduces various challenges in beam management. Towards building an effective beam management system when a user is moving, various steps are present like beam selection, beam tracking, beam alignment, and beam forming. Hence the subsequent sections of the paper illustrate various beam management procedures in mmWave using conventional methods as well as using deep learning techniques. The paper also presents a case study on the framework's implementation using the above-mentioned techniques in mmWave communication. Also glimpses on future research directions are detailed in the final sections. Such beam management techniques when used for mmWave technology will enable build fast, efficient, and capable 5G networks."",,,International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication,,,,2023-10-07,2023,2023-10-07,,11,10s,676-696,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Pawar, Sheetal";" Venkatesan, Mithra"",""Pawar, Sheetal (Research Scholar: E&TC Dept., Dr. D.

The antenna array spans the range from 27 to 40 GHz, whereas the impedance of the antenna element is matched at 50 Ω. The gain of the antenna element is between 5.5 and 8.5 dBi, and its radiation efficiency is between 65 and 90%. With high impedance matching for 5G MMW (Millimeter Wave), particularly at 28 GHz and 38 GHz, the 2-port antenna array operates in the frequency range of 27–40 GHz. The suggested MIMO array operates effectively with a gain of approximately 10 dBi and a radiation efficiency of approximately 95%. The antenna array's overall dimensions are a length of 55.27 mm, a width of 27.635 mm, and a depth of 1.6 mm with partial ground. A FR-4 substrate is used in the antenna's fabrication, greatly reducing the cost. In the antenna array, a decoupling surface is used between the antennas, with orthogonality being maintained between the ports to reduce mutual coupling. The results of the modelling show a reduction in the measured mutual coupling between array ports of less than − 35 dB. An envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of less than 1 × 10–4 is preferable. Additionally, the channel loss capacity is less than 0.3 bits/s/Hz, the mean effective gain is approximately − 6 dB, and the total active reflection coefficient is upgraded to be less than − 30 dB. Moreover, a diversity gain of approximately 10 dB is achieved. The proposed construction was created using CST Microwave Studio 2019. When the antennas are constructed and tested, the experimental outcomes surpass those of the simulation. Each antenna element is 27.635 mm long, 27.635 mm wide, and 1.6 mm thick. Slots in the radiating circular patch antenna element could be used to improve the radiation characteristics across the intended bands.

We apply a thin-film integrated passive device (TFIPD), ideal for use in Radio Frequency (RF) front-end systems due to its streamlined design, ease of integration, and decreased losses. We utilize a Chebyshev filter formation for the BPF design, implementing a pole-zero to generate a notch pattern. The pole-zero is formed by integrating capacitance and inductance into the resonant circuit blueprint, thus enhancing the sharp-drop capability of the BPF and adjusting the passband width. The inductor component in our suggested BPF arrangements employs a spiral inductor based on an air-bridge structure to minimize unwanted effects, while a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor is incorporated into the capacitor component to streamline the construction. The BPF in the n78 band exhibits transmission zeros at 3.017 and 4.448 GHz at the center frequency, with a minimum insertion loss (ILmin) of 0.824 dB, a maximum insertion loss (ILmax) of 1.215 dB, a return loss of 27.439 dB.

The experimental results confirm that our proposed antenna achieves a wide −10 dB impedance bandwidth of about 20.2% (25.5–31.2 GHz), a small reflection coefficient of −45 dB, high efficiency of 82%, and a measured peak realized gain of 6.9 dB at 28 GHz."",,,IEEE Journal on Miniaturization for Air and Space Systems,,,,2022-06-01,2022,2022-08-02,2022-06-01,3,2,47-52,Closed,Article,""Hammoumi, Mohamed El"; Tubbal, Faisel; Idrissi, Najiba El Amrani El; Raad, Raad; Theoharis, Panagiotis Ioannis; Lalbakhsh, Ali;" Abulgasem, Suhila"",""Hammoumi, Mohamed El (Faculty of Science and Technologies, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, 30000, Morocco)"; Tubbal, Faisel (School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia; Technological Projects Department, Libyan Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science, Tripoli, Libya); Idrissi, Najiba El Amrani El (Faculty of Science and Technologies, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, 30000, Morocco); Raad, Raad (School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia); Theoharis, Panagiotis Ioannis (School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia); Lalbakhsh, Ali (School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109, Australia; School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2007, Australia);" Abulgasem, Suhila (School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia)"",""Theoharis, Panagiotis Ioannis (University of Wollongong)"",""Hammoumi, Mohamed El (Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University)"; Tubbal, Faisel (University of Wollongong; Technological Projects Department, Libyan Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science, Tripoli, Libya); Idrissi, Najiba El Amrani El (Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University); Raad, Raad (University of Wollongong); Theoharis, Panagiotis Ioannis (University of Wollongong); Lalbakhsh, Ali (Macquarie University; University of Technology Sydney);" Abulgasem, Suhila (University of Wollongong)"",17,17,,7.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149940597,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is urgent to conduct in-depth and systematic research on the planning methods of China’s rural networked roads. A road network model oriented to rural road network planning is proposed. First, the traffic demand is predicted, and then remote sensing technology and computer technology are used to evaluate the technical performance of the rural road network. The experimental results show that the comprehensive evaluation index value is 0.8 by combining the weight of each index, and the planning scheme is comprehensively evaluated.

In each network slice, to precisely control the service quality and cost, deploying the service-required virtual network functions (VNFs) by utilizing the linkage between the characteristics of this slicing task and the characteristics of different servers in the B5G network is essential. Therefore, aiming at gaining the ability of learning and adapting new tasks quickly and cost effectively, we view the NFV deployment problem as a meta relational learning process that explores the meta mapping relation between service-tailored slicing tasks and the B5G physical network and propose a service-tailored VNF deployment framework, abbreviated as StailNet. Instead of training a one-strategy-fits-all deployment model, we focus on “learning” how to train a deployment model and propose to learn the features of servers and slicing tasks from the perspective of knowledge graph-based representation learning, then locate the initial meta mapping relation by extracting meta information in the task-agnostic meta space and exploring the service-tailored meta mapping relation in the task space for each task, so that we can quickly obtain the solution by a few gradients on the initial meta mapping relation. To highlight the performances of StailNet, we do comprehensive simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that our StailNet outperforms the selected representative algorithms in the literature."",,This work was supported by the Science and Technology Major Project of Henan Province (Song Shan Laboratory) under Grant 221100210900-03.,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2023-01-15,2023,2023-08-09,2023-01-15,10,24,22542-22554,Closed,Article,""Xu, Zexi"; Zhuang, Lei; Zhuang, Weihua; Hu, Yuxiang; Mo, Wenshuai;" Wang, Zihao"",""Xu, Zexi (School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China)"; Zhuang, Lei (School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China); Zhuang, Weihua (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, N2L 3G1, Canada); Hu, Yuxiang (Institute of Information Technology, PLA Strategic Support Force Information Engineering University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China); Mo, Wenshuai (Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China);" Wang, Zihao (School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450001, China)"",""Zhuang, Lei (Zhengzhou University)"",""Xu, Zexi (Zhengzhou University)"; Zhuang, Lei (Zhengzhou University); Zhuang, Weihua (University of Waterloo); Hu, Yuxiang (PLA Information Engineering University); Mo, Wenshuai (Zhengzhou University);" Wang, Zihao (Zhengzhou University)"",3,3,,2.24,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163161655,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4611 Machine Learning,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The channel noise estimator is a global gamma cluster, which we extend to allow for Bayesian tracking of non-stationary noise variation.

Thus, how to meet the transmission requirements with the minimum building cost has become an urgent problem. The existing studies abstract this problem into a network design problem with relays (NDPR). However, these studies only focus on whether all target areas can be covered, and ignore timely reliability. Secondly, they use the number of hops to measure the transmission delay and ignore the actual transmission process. Therefore, to solve the above problems, we study the 5 G base station optimization location model considering timely reliability. Firstly, combining the definition of network reliability and the law of large numbers, we establish the timely reliability model, and transform it into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Secondly, considering the transmission process, we propose a novel NDPR model to optimize the base station location and propose a partial optimization algorithm to solve the large-scale case. Besides, taking the smart grid as an example, the validity of the proposed method is verified.

The main approach is a vertical end-to-end solution from sensors to intelligence and back to actuators. Recently, a new holistic approach, the so-called Digital Twin, has emerged. This goes beyond traditional smart solutions by replicating, with high-fidelity cross-domain aspects, a physical object into the digital world. The key differentiation is the inclusion of semantics information in the digital replica in a form of knowledge graph. Further, analytics continuously enrich Digital Twin’s information with predictions and insights. In this article, we adopt the Digital Twin approach for the creation of a digital replica of Espinardo’s campus at the University of Murcia (Spain). The starting point is the existing sensor network deployment and the infrastructure under development of Fog–Edge–Cloud computing based on a 5G private network. The smart campus Digital Twin is formed by the Digital Twins of 23 buildings for which different sets of data features have been thoroughly selected. We implement the concept of Digital Twin by merging sensor data with external open data sources, analytics models implemented, and information processed by these analytics. We report our experience showing the issues encountered handling the data and producing various analytics models for predicting energy consumption, building occupancy, room usage, solar energy, and anomaly detection. From our experience, we highlight some lessons learned and directions toward the full operational smart campus Digital Twin."",""Spain’s Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) is leading the smart campus project, called “Distributed Computing Intelligence,” as a precommercial procurement of R&amp";D&amp;"I services (Precommercial Public Procurement).

To develop suitable communications systems, novel simulation approaches are needed that account for the specifics of the evolving technology. This article presents a modular link level simulator for the physical layer of beyond‐5G and 6G wireless communication systems in the THz range. The simulator, that is oriented toward the IEEE Std 802.15.3d‐2017 is contrasted to the state of the art of physical layer simulation tools. Its concept and basic building blocks are presented and the simulator is validated by channel simulations considering an AWGN channel model. Moreover, it is applied to a top‐of‐rack scenario in a wirelessly augmented data center.

Plain Language Summary Terahertz communications are a promising candidate to deliver very high data rates up to 1 Tbit/s for next generation wireless systems. In this paper we present a new simulation module of the Simulator for Mobile Networks (SiMoNe) for the physical layer that considers important effects such as waveforms and impairments of radio frequency devices. The simulator is compared to the state of the art and its principles and basic building blocks are explained. Moreover, the simulator is validated and applied to a top‐of‐rack scenario in a future data center with wireless links on top of racks. The simulations show the necessity of line‐of‐sight conditions and high requirements on the electronic devices for a successful transmission over longer distances. The gained data set of simulation results can be used for further investigations on higher layer performance by the community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Smart logistics enterprises realize the “three streams in one” of the logistics industry through informatization and intelligent management, which greatly improves the service efficiency and quality of logistics enterprises. However, there are still many problems in this intelligent logistics mode. In this context, we conduct research experiments on the logistics ecosystem of IoT architecture scenarios and draw conclusions through experiments: (1) logistics development in IoT building scenarios. The environment includes natural environment, economic environment, political environment, etc. The economic environment plays an important role in driving logistics demand and promoting logistics growth. The political environment helps to improve the logistics infrastructure and ensure the healthy development of logistics. (2) The most important cost of the logistics industry is that transportation costs account for 67% of the entire logistics cost, followed by cargo storage accounting for 16% of the cost, and smart express cabinets accounting for 13% of the cost. From this, we can see the highest cost out of the logistics system under the Internet of Things is the transportation cost. As a unity is closely linked to the economy and interdependent, logistics is the driving force to promote the development of economic integration. In order to ensure the sustainable development of the economy, it is necessary to continuously improve the service level of logistics, reduce logistics costs, improve operation efficiency, strengthen the linkage development with other industries, and enhance the competitiveness of logistics. We launched an investigation against this background and researched the logistics system under the scenario logistics ecosystem of beyond 5G and IoT architecture."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding this work.,,Security and Communication Networks,,Hangjun Che,,2022-08-19,2022,2022-08-19,2022-08-19,2022,1,1-11,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Yao, Wei";" Li, Yudong"",""Yao, Wei (School of Business, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau 999078, China must.edu.mo)";" Li, Yudong (School of Business, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau 999078, China must.edu.mo)"",""Yao, Wei (Macau University of Science and Technology)"",""Yao, Wei (Macau University of Science and Technology)";" Li, Yudong (Macau University of Science and Technology)"",2,2,,0.85,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/5797503.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150362920,46 Information and Computing Sciences";" 4605 Data Management and Data Science,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the main directions of their development at present is the implementation of the concept of building the Internet of Things (IoT). The development of IoT includes the development of both technologies for obtaining information and technologies, as well as methods for organizing communication channels and networks for transmitting data between elements of these networks. Features of IoT networks are largely determined by the features of applied tasks and their scope. These features consist both in the ways of obtaining information and the formation of transmitted messages for their transmission, and in the way of building the IoT networks themselves. One of the characteristic features of IoT networks is the high density of devices (network nodes). It should be noted that the distribution of subscriber density across the planet, continents and countries is extremely uneven. Almost every country in the world has regions with high and low subscriber densities. It is reasonable to assume that the density of the IoT network can have different density in different regions and territories, as well as in different operating conditions. The above traffic features, as well as the structural characteristics of the IoT network, require the development of models and methods to implement the IoT functionality in various conditions, as well as ensure its coexistence with existing and future heterogeneous communication networks. One of the most popular in external IP-oriented networks is the practical use of mechanisms of differentiated service Diffserv. The purpose of the work is to ensure the quality of Internet of Things service in the LTE/5G standard network by developing and improving traffic management methods and models that ensure the most efficient provision of services to them. The main architectural feature of the proposed model, which distinguishes the intelligent control system from the one built according to the """"traditional"""" scheme, is connected with the connection of knowledge storage and processing mechanisms to realize the ability to perform the necessary functions in incompletely specified (or uncertain) conditions with the random nature of external influences."",,,Telecommunication and information technologies,,,,2022,2022,2022,2022,77,4,,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Khlaponin, Yu.

DT focuses on connecting the virtual and physical world as an emerging strategic technology. Initially, it was implemented through mirror models of physical objects to realize the monitoring of their whole life cycle in the manufacturing area. In recent years, DT technologies have been applied in different fields, and some typical DT solutions have been proposed to solve complex system problems. In this paper, we study the problem of how to combine the DT and other emerging technologies for UAV autonomy development and supervision, aiming to propose a basic DT framework to integrate DT and UAVs as reference rules for building DT systems, which includes four parts, that is, Virtual Space, Real Space, Service Center, and Data and Model Processing Center. Based on the proposed basic DT framework, a cloud-based DT system is then further constructed in which cloud platform, 5G, and VR are integrated seamlessly. The running and implementation processes of each subsystem are introduced in detail. Multiple experiments are conducted to verify the usefulness of proposed DT system, that is, real-time system monitoring and cloud processing, VR connection, human–robot interaction through VR technology, and so on. The experimental results show that the proposed DTUAV system can be used in the interaction of virtual and physical systems, remote supervision, intelligence integration of swarm of unmanned vehicles, and so on. The development in our work introduces the DT into unmanned system applications and can promote relevant research in this direction.

The industry has more than 12 million employers with over 250 million employees and creates almost $1.9 trillion worth of structures yearly. Software industry remains the main driver of growth in China. Basically, a task is developed to meet market demands or demands in a timely fashion. Different possibilities may be thought about in the conceptual drawing board, and also the technical and also financial feasibility of each alternative will be assessed and compared in order to select the very best feasible job. The software industry in China is forecast to grow by 7.7% in 2021, driven by strong Y-o-Y growth in the first quarter, reflecting the comparison to the previous year's period when construction work was halted across most of the country. Thereafter, the software industry is expected to record an average annual growth of 4.2% between 2022 and 2025. The industry's growth over the forecast period is expected to be driven by investments on new infrastructure, including investment in the areas of 5G networks, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, and data centers. According to the government-backed think tank, the China Electronic Information Industry Development, the country is expected to spend CNY10 trillion (US$1.4 trillion) on new infrastructure projects between 2020 and 2025. This study evaluated factors affecting construction sector performance: explanatory factor analysis evidence from China. From the literature reviewed, it was established that entering the Chinese software development marketis still seen as exciting but difficult by many foreign contractors and consultants. The study found out that rising material and labor costs, labor woes, increased competition and shrinking profit margins were some of the challenges construction firms in Chin face. The study concludes that the implementation of construction safety laws and the rate of subcontracting are relevant factors affecting construction sector in China, while neither the extent of using temporary workers, nor the availability of resources, nor the level of per capita GDP has any effects."",,,Journal of Entrepreneurship & Project Management,,,,2022-08-26,2022,2022-08-26,,6,4,1-13,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Shi, Wang Wuei"",""Shi, Wang Wuei ()"",,""Shi, Wang Wuei ()"",0,0,,0.0,https://stratfordjournals.org/journals/index.php/journal-of-entrepreneurship-proj/article/download/1234/1557,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150546061,""33 Built Environment and Design"; 3302 Building; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences;" 4612 Software Engineering"",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Building on 4G and 5G, 6G networks will work to more fully enable the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, working to provide secure wireless computing for the digital world. In order to ensure the resource utilization of edge computing, it is usually necessary to allocate resources among mobile devices. Many scholars have applied auction theory to resource allocation in mobile edge networks and achieved specific results in recent years. However, most existing studies unilaterally consider the utility of users or edge servers, and few jointly consider social welfare and user selection priorities, which cannot maximize the overall utility of mobile edge networks. This paper proposes a multi-round auction algorithm that pursues maximizing social welfare in a multi-user–multi-server network. The algorithm combines combinatorial auction with double auction, allowing users and servers to adjust their bids and asking prices in each auction round. To enhance the generalizability of the study, the algorithm takes full advantage of the flexibility of the auction mechanism and considers the users’ demand for different servers, the variability of bidding strategies, and the variability of the total resources of edge servers so that the users can obtain resources with higher priority and improve social welfare. To ensure that social welfare is maximized, we adopt the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) payment mechanism and consider the effect of network externalities. Extensive comparative experiments show that the algorithm can effectively improve social welfare and maximize the overall benefits of the mobile edge network."",""This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. 61962026, the National Natural Science Key Foundation of China grant No. 61832014 and No. 62032016, the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province under Grant No. 20192ACBL21031 and the Foundation of Jiangxi Educational Committee under Grant No. GJJ210338."",,Future Generation Computer Systems,,,,2023-03,2023,,2023-03,140,,365-375,Closed,Article,""Xiao, Jianmao"; Gao, Qinghang; Yang, Zhenyue; Cao, Yuanlong; Wang, Hao;" Feng, Zhiyong"",""Xiao, Jianmao (School of Software, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, China)"; Gao, Qinghang (School of Software, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, China); Yang, Zhenyue (School of Software, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, China); Cao, Yuanlong (School of Software, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, China); Wang, Hao (School of Software, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, 330022, China);" Feng, Zhiyong (College of Intelligence and Computing, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China)"",""Cao, Yuanlong (Jiangxi Normal University)"",""Xiao, Jianmao (Jiangxi Normal University)"; Gao, Qinghang (Jiangxi Normal University); Yang, Zhenyue (Jiangxi Normal University); Cao, Yuanlong (Jiangxi Normal University); Wang, Hao (Jiangxi Normal University);" Feng, Zhiyong (Tianjin University)"",8,8,,5.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152455385,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, inherent deficiencies of traditionally processing technology restrain the current materials to fabricate desirable architectures for SE applications. Herein, taking full advantages of 3D printing in free-construction, architected honeycombs featuring lightweight and high-efficient EMI SE are designed with polylactic acid (PLA) as matrix, and graphene nanosheets and carbon nanotubes hybrids (GNs/CNTs) as functional fillers. The optimal printed material shows a high electrical conductivity up to 110.8 S/m and outstanding EMI SE property of 53.5 dB, far exceeding the standard of commercially shielding materials (20 dB). More encouragingly, this work makes a deep insight into the intrinsic connection of porous structure of 3D-printed components on shielding mechanism, which reveals that as the pore size is far less than a certain proportion of incident wavelength (λ/5), the components exhibit a good reconcilability on the lightweight (0.4–1.0 g/cm3) and high-performance EMI SE (35–45 dB).

In this regard, testbeds are considered as one of the most important and effective experimental platforms for performing tests, thus paving the way towards the real-world implementation of many solutions, from the most basic to the most disruptive and innovative ones. Compared to computer simulators, testbeds provide near-realistic implementation and can obtain practical results while posing less risk to live networks. They are also cheaper compared to field trials. Given the crucial role of testbeds in the cellular network ecosystem, it is imperative to create awareness regarding the design challenges associated with constructing an effective and efficient testbed deployment. In this tutorial, we discuss the design considerations and challenges we experienced while deploying an outdoor testbed that we call TurboRAN—a 5G and beyond network testbed facility. It is designed to facilitate the evaluation of early real-world use case algorithm implementations and deployments. We present the process and methodology used to select components, including antennas, amplifiers, base stations, and cabinets, to name a few, and describe the integration of the components to construct a fully operational testbed. Finally, we discuss a use case that demonstrates the TurboRAN’s ability to conduct real-world experiments. The use case demonstrates the detrimental impact of sub-optimal handover parameter configuration on network performance—a big challenge in modern cellular communication.

For encoding, the previous LDPC codewords corresponding to a TB (at prior time slot) are interleaved and superimposed onto the current LDPC codewords, resulting in the transmitted codewords. For decoding, the sliding window decoding algorithm with sum-product or min-sum implementations can be employed, inheriting a relatively low-latency decoding. A distinguished advantage of the proposed coded transmission over spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes is that the encoder/decoder of the proposed codes can be designed by reusing the encoder/decoder architecture of component block LDPC codes. To analyze the waterfall performance of BMST-LDPC code ensembles, we present the protograph-based EXIT chart analysis, which can efficiently predict the error-correcting performance in waterfall region. To analyze the error-floor performance of BMST-LDPC codes, we employ the genie-aided (GA) lower bound, which can efficiently predict the error-correcting performance in error-floor region. For ease of implementation, the BMST-LDPC codes are constructed by taking the (2, 4)-raptor-like LDPC codes or the 5G LDPC codes as the basic components. The numerical results reveal that the proposed codes can have capacity-approaching performance, exhibiting a gap of 0.007 ​dB away from the corresponding Shannon limit. They also reveal that, by using the proposed BMST construction, the error-correcting performance of the original 5G block LDPC codes can be significantly improved, achieving coding gains up to one dB over the AWGN channels and two dB over the fast fading channels."",,,Journal of Information and Intelligence,,,,2023-07,2023,,2023-07,1,2,115-133,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Wang, Qianfan"; Guo, Kongjing;" Ma, Xiao"",""Wang, Qianfan (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China"; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China); Guo, Kongjing (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China; Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China); Ma, Xiao (School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China;" Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China)"",""Ma, Xiao (Sun Yat-sen University";" Sun Yat-sen University)"",""Wang, Qianfan (Sun Yat-sen University"; Sun Yat-sen University); Guo, Kongjing (Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University); Ma, Xiao (Sun Yat-sen University;" Sun Yat-sen University)"",3,3,,2.55,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiixd.2023.05.001,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158423609,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The working principle of each key storage technology in the smart logistics process is analyzed to find out the equipment factors affecting the carbon emission of each storage technology in the smart logistics process, and the carbon emission calculation model of each key storage technology is established separately by using the carbon emission factor method. Meanwhile, according to the development history of energy consumption assessment, the assessment process of different stages from logistics storage energy consumption assessment to smart logistics energy consumption assessment is analyzed, and based on this, a carbon emission energy consumption assessment framework based on 5G shared smart logistics is constructed. This paper applies the supply chain idea to define the smart logistics supply chain, constructs a conceptual model of the smart logistics supply chain considering carbon emissions, and at the same time combines the characteristics of the smart logistics supply chain to analyze the correlation between the carbon emissions of the smart logistics supply chain and the related social, environmental, and economic systems."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Sensors,,Gengxin Sun,,2022-01-12,2022,2022-01-12,2022-01-12,2022,1,1-13,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Zhang, Ailing"; Li, Sha; Tan, Lin; Sun, Yingchao;" Yao, Fuxiao"",""Zhang, Ailing (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China)"; Li, Sha (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China); Tan, Lin (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China); Sun, Yingchao (Qingdao Administrative Service and Public Resources Trading Center, Qingdao, Shandong 266071, China);" Yao, Fuxiao (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China)"",""Zhang, Ailing (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China)"",""Zhang, Ailing (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China)"; Li, Sha (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China); Tan, Lin (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China); Sun, Yingchao (Qingdao Administrative Service and Public Resources Trading Center, Qingdao, Shandong 266071, China);" Yao, Fuxiao (Shandong Vocational and Technical University of International Studies, Rizhao Shandong 276800, China)"",13,10,,5.02,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/js/2022/8223590.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144636509,""40 Engineering";" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",12 Responsible Consumption and Production"; 13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The top and bottom electrodes are made of aluminium (Al), the piezoelectric materials used are zinc oxide (ZnO) and barium titanate (BaTiO3), and the substrate is silicon (Si). The BaTiO3-based resonators can function better at high temperatures because BaTiO3 has the highest thermal stability of any piezoelectric material where as ZnO is mostly used to build sensors and actuators due to lower flaws and MEMS compatibility. Also, the resonator attains remarkable Quality factors of 1895 and 1780 for ZnO and BaTiO3 at 5.6 GHz, respectively.

However, IRS control in existing studies assumes information sharing and control instructions from base stations (BSs), thus requiring a backhaul link to the core network and BSs. This requires the construction of a network system, ruining the advantages of IRS, such as its low cost and installation flexibility. Therefore, a standalone-IRS, which is completely independent of the core network and BSs, is expected to maximize the performance of the IRS. However, a standalone-IRS cannot obtain sufficient information for control decisions, such as channel state information, which is frequently used in existing studies";" therefore, inefficient control methods, such as exploration, must be used. Thus, this study proposes a significant reduction in the overhead required for exploration by hierarchical exploration and a reduction in the exploration itself using codebooks to store the results of exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the degradation of communication quality owing to the use of hierarchical exploration and codebooks, we propose an effective beamwidth expansion method for hierarchical exploration and an efficient codebook construction method based on user distribution as elemental methods. In this study, we evaluated the overhead reduction and communication quality of the standalone-IRS control by combining these methods through simulations."",""This study was partly commissioned by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), JAPAN."",,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2023-04-13,2023,2023-04-13,,72,9,11990-12000,Closed,Article,""Hibi, Ryuhei"; Kawamoto, Yuichi;" Kato, Nei"",""Hibi, Ryuhei (Graduate School of Information Sciences (GSIS), Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan)"; Kawamoto, Yuichi (Graduate School of Information Sciences (GSIS), Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan);" Kato, Nei (Graduate School of Information Sciences (GSIS), Tohoku University, Sendai, 980-8579, Japan)"",""Hibi, Ryuhei (Tohoku University)"",""Hibi, Ryuhei (Tohoku University)"; Kawamoto, Yuichi (Tohoku University);" Kato, Nei (Tohoku University)"",6,6,,5.18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157228096,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This requires heavy usage of advanced deep learning techniques in a closed-loop way to auto-build the suitable decisions, enabling to meet network slices’ requirements. In this context, Federated Learning (FL) is playing a vital role in training deep learning models in a collaborative way among thousands of network slice participants while ensuring their privacy and hence network slice isolation. Specifically, running network slices may share only their model parameters with a central entity, e.g., Inter Domain Slice Manager, to aggregate them and build a global model. Thus, the central entity does not directly access the training data. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where an insider participant may upload poisoning updates to the central entity so that it can cause a construction failure of the global model and thus affect its global performance. Therefore, it is crucial to design security means to detect and mitigate such threats. In this paper, we design a novel framework to automatically detect malicious participants in the FL process. In particular, our framework first uses a deep reinforcement algorithm to dynamically select a network slice as a trusted participant, based mainly on its reputation. The selected participant will then be in charge of identifying poisoning model updates by leveraging unsupervised machine learning. We demonstrate the feasibility of our framework on top of a real dataset that we generate using the 5G OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform. Evaluation results show the efficiency of our framework in dealing with poisoning attacks even with the presence of several malicious participants."",,This work has been partially supported by the European Union’s H2020 MonB5G (grant no. 871780) project.,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,,,,2023-05-22,2023,2023-05-22,2023-06-01,20,2,1612-1624,All OA";" Green,Article,""Saad, Sabra Ben"; Brik, Bouziane;" Ksentini, Adlen"",""Saad, Sabra Ben (Communication Systems Department, EURECOM, 06904, Sophia Antipolis, France)"; Brik, Bouziane (DRIVE EA1859, University of Bourgogne, 58000, Nevers, France);" Ksentini, Adlen (Communication Systems Department, EURECOM, 06904, Sophia Antipolis, France)"",""Saad, Sabra Ben (EURECOM)"",""Saad, Sabra Ben (EURECOM)"; Brik, Bouziane (University of Burgundy);" Ksentini, Adlen (EURECOM)"",15,15,,12.21,https://hal.science/hal-04134526/file/TNSM-2022-05800_Proof_hi.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158256975,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The devices are fabricated by the thermal evaporation technique under a vacuum pressure of 10–5 mbar. Structural and morphological analyses have shown the preferred growth of cubic phase of lead selenide resulting in a large lattice mismatched structure at the n-$$n-$$ Si/p-$$p-$$ PbSe (SP) interfaces. The construction of the energy band diagram also indicated the presence of a valance band offset of 0.57 eV at the SP interfaces. These two effects together resulted in a significant photovoltaic effect presented by large–short-circuit photocurrent density of the SP devices. In addition, the SP devices performed as good X-ray sensors responsive to an X-ray (λ = 1.5405Å) beam of low and high power tested in the range of 0.1–35.0 W. Moreover, SP layers treated as microwave cavities displayed negative capacitance (NC) effect in the frequency domain of 1.2–1.8 GHz. The NC effect is controlled by two Lorentz oscillators being dominant at resonance frequencies of 0.7 and 1.2 GHz. It is found that the SP microwave cavities exhibit cutoff frequency values exceeding 10 GHz when the driving frequency is mounted at 1.2 GHz. This feature makes the SP cavities suitable for use in wireless 5G technology applications as signal filters. The ability of the SP layers to perform as photovoltaic devices, X-ray sensors and microwave cavities nominates them for use as multifunctional devices suiting modern technology needs."",""This work was funded by the University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, under Grant No. (UJ-22-DR-99).

Through literature review and interviews with autonomous driving practitioners, this paper firstly puts forward a logical framework for designing a cerebrum-like autonomous driving system. Secondly, situated on this framework, it builds a hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) model as well as a TOPSIS-GRA algorithm for making ICV autonomous driving decisions by employing a data fusion approach between the entropy weight method (EWM) and analytic hierarchy process method (AHP) and by employing a model fusion approach between the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and grey relational analysis (GRA). The HFSM model is composed of two layers: the global FSM model and the local FSM model. The decision of the former acts as partial input information of the latter and the result of the latter is sent forward to the local path-planning module, meanwhile pulsating feedback to the former as real-time refresh data. To identify different traffic scenarios in a cerebrum-like way, the global FSM model is designed as 7 driving behavior states and 17 driving characteristic events, and the local FSM model is designed as 16 states and 8 characteristic events. In respect to designing a cerebrum-like algorithm for state transition, this paper firstly fuses AHP weight and EWM weight at their output layer to generate a synthetic weight coefficient for each characteristic event";" then, it further fuses TOPSIS method and GRA method at the model building layer to obtain the implementable order of state transition. To verify the feasibility, reliability, and safety of the HFSM model as well as its TOPSIS-GRA state transition algorithm, this paper elaborates on a series of simulative experiments conducted on the PreScan8.50 platform. The results display that the accuracy of obstacle detection gets 98%, lane line prediction is beyond 70 m, the speed of collision avoidance is higher than 45 km/h, the distance of collision avoidance is less than 5 m, path planning time for obstacle avoidance is averagely less than 50 ms, and brake deceleration is controlled under 6 m/s2. These technical indexes support that the driving states set and characteristic events set for the HFSM model as well as its TOPSIS-GRA algorithm may bring about cerebrum-like decision-making effectiveness for ICV autonomous driving under 5G-V2X intelligent road infrastructure."",""This research was supported by Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau, Chongqing Education Commission, and Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences."",""This research was funded by Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau (No. cstc2021jsyj-yzysbAX0008), Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences (No. P2021JG13) and 2021 Humanities and Social Sciences Program of Chongqing Education Commission (No. 21SKGH227)."",Computers Materials & Continua,,,,2023-01-24,2023,2023-01-24,2023,75,1,1051-1071,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Fu, Shijun";" Fu, Hongji"",""Fu, Shijun (Department of Logistics Engineering, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, Chongqing, 402160, China)";" Fu, Hongji (School of Mechanical & Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510641, China)"",""Fu, Shijun (Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences)"",""Fu, Shijun (Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences)";" Fu, Hongji (South China University of Technology)"",3,3,,2.26,https://file.techscience.com/files/cmc/2023/TSP_CMC-75-1/TSP_CMC_34495/TSP_CMC_34495.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155169663,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The electrical loss tangent is observed around 0.2–0.3. Cement mortar slabs with CDA as sand replacement are prototyped. Sand replacement till 15 % by volume is investigated. Considerable reduction in compressive strength is reported in literature for sand replacement beyond 15 %. After 28 days of curing, the prototyped slabs are subjected to electromagnetic shielding effectiveness determination, as per ASTM 4935 two antenna standard, in the X band of frequencies centred around 10 GHz. Shielding Effectiveness (SE) around 7 dB is observed for 3 % CDA as sand replacement, around 10 dB for 10 % replacement, and around 20 dB for 15 % CDA. Compressive strength measurement employing Universal Testing machine presented significant reduction in compressive strength as CDA replacement tend towards 15 %. Employing CDA loaded cement mortar for plastering, is a low cost, easy deployable solution for realizing customized electromagnetic shielding levels in buildings housing critical electrical and electronic infrastructure including servers and data centres. Realizing low cost, easy deployable customized shielding solutions is an upcoming research domain, primarily due to the anticipated increase in ambient electromagnetic field levels in our surroundings caused by the rampant deployment of communication technologies including 5G and IoT. Apart from providing positive environmental impact, acting as sand replacement, enhanced CDA utilization by engineering sectors can lead to good revenue generation model for rural economic development."",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Materials Today Proceedings,,,,2023-02,2023,,2023-02,,,,Closed,Article,""Popuri, Vamsi Krishna"; Kuppala, Sunilu Kumar;" Narayanan, B.

These procedures mainly utilize stochastic and deterministic approaches for signal strength prediction to locate the optimum cellular tower (eNodeB) position for 4G and 5G systems. Since environment selection is limited by urban, suburban, and rural areas, they do not cover complex macro and micro variations, especially buildings and tree canopies having a higher impact on signal fading due to scattering and absorption. Therefore, they usually end up with high prediction errors. This article proposes an efficient architecture for the deployment of communication systems. The proposed method determines the effect of the environment via extracting tree and building properties by using a classified 3D map and You Only Look Once (YOLO) V5, which is one of the most efficient deep learning algorithms. According to the results, the mean average precision (mAP) 0.5% and mAP 0.95% accuracies are obtained as 0.96 and 0.45, and image color classification (ICC) findings indicate 77.6% accuracy on vegetation detection, especially for tree canopies. Thus, the obtained results significantly improved signal strength prediction with a 3.96% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) rate, while other empirical models’ prediction errors fall in the range of 6.07–15.26%."",Not applicable.,There is no funding to report.,EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,,,,2022-10-23,2022,2022-10-23,,2022,1,107,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Egi, Yunus";" Eyceyurt, Engin"",""Egi, Yunus (Collage of Engineering and Technology, American University of Middle East, 54200, Egaila, Kuwait)";" Eyceyurt, Engin (Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli University, 50300, Nevsehir, Turkey)"",""Egi, Yunus (American University of the Middle East)"",""Egi, Yunus (American University of the Middle East)";" Eyceyurt, Engin (Nevşehir Hacı Bektaş Veli University)"",2,2,,1.04,https://jwcn-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13638-022-02188-2,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152139725,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research paper presents a novel approach to reducing leakage power by inserting two leakage transistors in the middle of pull-down and pull-up paths. Out of these two leakage transistors, one is the PMOS transistor, and another one is the NMOS transistor. This research work presents a dynamic CMOS inverter and 6T SRAM cell with and without transmission gate (TG) to reduce leakage power using the LECTOR and LECTOR-B techniques. The Cadence Virtuoso simulation tool is used to presents the results in terms of static power. Using the 45-nm technology node, the performance in terms of static power is analyzed. It is observed that using LECTOR and LECTOR-B techniques, the overall reduction in static power is 26% and 20%, respectively, compared to the conventional design for SRAM cell. Similar improvements are also noted for dynamic CMOS inverter and TG SRAM cell. Since the operating range of 5G communication networks is the same as that of the previous generation, there are no difficulties in using these antennas on 5G communication networks. For any technology, the use of antennas makes it possible to bring data rates closer to maximum values. The new technology that uses separate receivers and transmitters on the same frequency band has further increased the speed of receiving and transmitting data. The design of the existing 4G modem provides for the use of antenna technology. The proposed model provides the construction of a multidimensional antenna. The other passive devices it has a one-way direction, which increases the received signal and reduces the amount of interference from the sides to the back. Therefore, the proposed model possible to increase the signal level to acceptable values, even at unstable reception levels thereby increasing the speed of receiving and transmitting the information. The undoubted advantage of panel antennas is their low cost and exceptional reliability. There is practically nothing in the design that can be broken even when falling from a great height. The only weak point is the high-frequency cable, which can break at the point where it enters the case. To extend the life of the device, the cable must be securely connected."",,,ICTACT Journal on Microelectronics,,,,2022-04-01,2022,2022-04-01,2022-04-01,8,1,1269-1274,All OA";" Gold,Article,""J, Logeshwaran";" Selvaraj, Karthick"",""J, Logeshwaran ()";" Selvaraj, Karthick ()"",,""J, Logeshwaran ()";" Selvaraj, Karthick ()"",48,48,,20.86,https://doi.org/10.21917/ijme.2022.0219,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1181801590,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Propagation path routes are mainly classified into line of sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS). The NLOS routes are classified into 2 separate routes, namely, Hard_NLOS and Soft_NLOS. Their path loss models include free-space loss (Lfs) and multiscreen diffraction loss (Lmsd) together with the reflection from the building blocks. However, these NLOS routes can be combined into a single formula. The path loss models were fitted with measured path loss data at frequencies of 28 GHz and 73 GHz. These models are compared with four 5G empirical models, namely 5GCM, 3GPP, METIS, and mmMAGIC. The results show that the separated route models provide good agreement, especially for the hard routes compared with those models and provide the minimum MAE of 4.45 dB, 4.34 dB, and 6.72 dB for the hard route, soft route, and an all-NLOS route, respectively, for the dual-band frequency."",""Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

The traditional von Neumann architecture, whose principle is the separation of the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, not only limits the performance of the computer, but also causes a lot of energy consumption. The next generation of brain-inspired computing chips promises to break the von Neumann bottleneck by simulating the brain's neural networks, enabling a new computer architecture known as neuromorphic computing. Memristors have been found to be one of the best pieces of hardware for neuromorphic computing and the best components for building artificial neural networks. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of biomemristors as synaptic devices. Memristors and bio-synapses are first introduced, and then the research progress of biomemristors based on biomaterials and polymers is reported. Finally, the application prospects and challenges of biomemristors in synapses are pointed out.

In this work, four machine learning (ML) algorithms are proposed for PL prediction in an indoor environment for 5G millimeter-wave frequencies, from 26.5 to 40 GHz. They are artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and gradient tree boosting (GTB). We compare their performances, including also the empirical PL models ABG and CIF incorporating the number of crossed walls, as we propose. For the ML models, we present a methodology to select the predictor coalition by examining the marginal performance and the interpretability gains. The methodology allows choosing the most appropriate predictor coalition for building machines while not overlooking the non-linear connections between predictors and the path-loss. The results show that the ML techniques improve the prediction accuracy of empirical models. Among the ML algorithms employed, considering the optimal subset of predictors, the GTB model presents the best prediction and generalization capacities."",""The authors would like to thank the CNPq, Brazil (Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa) for financial support."",,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,2023-04,2023,,2023-04,215,,119324,Closed,Article,""Nuñez, Yoiz"; Lovisolo, Lisandro; da Silva Mello, Luiz;" Orihuela, Carlos"",""Nuñez, Yoiz (Center of Study in Telecommunications PUC-Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)"; Lovisolo, Lisandro (Department of Electronics and Comm.

                  With the development of 5G, the wireless Internet of Things (IoT) has become possible;" how to provide privacy protections for the communication of IoT devices in a more vulnerable wireless transmission environment is a huge challenge. Thus, steganography is introduced as a safe and effective technology. Blockchain systems have been widely used in the area of steganography. Several works attempted to embed covert data into transactions in public blockchain systems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero. However, most of them merely focus on putting covert data into certain fields in transactions based on cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, a Covert Transaction Recognition (CTR) model is proposed by the Text Convolutional Neural Networks and Back Propagation Neural Networks. When utilizing the covert data-embedded field for recognizing, our CTR model can attain 0.79 precision and 0.83 recall on average for seven covert transaction construction schemes. The precision and recall can increase by at most 43 and 47%, respectively, if other unembedded fields were additionally exploited for recognition. We further propose a Practical Covert Transaction Construction (PCTC) model. This model fixes the contents in the embedded fields of the constructed transactions, and generates the contents in other fields using Generative Adversarial Networks. Experimental results demonstrated that the precision and recall are greatly decreased when identifying the covert transactions generated by our PCTC model.

"480,pub.1153808386,10.3390/jsan11040087,,,Enabling LPWANs for Coexistence and Diverse IoT Applications in Smart Cities Using Lightweight Heterogenous Multihomed Network Model,""Smart cities have been envisioned to provide smartness in managing internet of things (IoT) application domains, such as transport and mobility, health care, natural resources, electricity and energy, homes and buildings, commerce and retail, society and workplace, industry, agriculture, and the environment. The growth trajectory in usage of these IoT domains has led to a heterogeneous dense network in a smart city environment. The heterogeneous dense network in smart cities has led to challenges, such as difficulties in the management of LPWAN coexistence, interference, spectrum insufficiency, QoS, and scalability issues. The existing LPWAN technologies cannot support the heterogeneous dense network challenges in smart cities. Further, it cannot support diverse IoT, including medium- to high-bandwidth applications, due to the power, complexity, and resource constraints of the LPWAN devices. Hence, this paper addresses high data rate IoT applications and heterogeneous dense networks. This paper proposes a lightweight heterogenous multihomed network (LHM-N) model for diverse smart city applications that will address dense heterogeneity network challenges in a smart city. The work aims to advocate and integrate a manageable license-free LPWAN that will coexist with 5G private and public cellular networks in the LHM-N model. This will help to provide a cost-effective solution model in a heterogeneous dense smart city environment. Further, a secured lightweight energy-efficient packet-size forwarding engine (PSFE) algorithm is presented using the discrete event simulation (DES) methodological approach in MATLAB for complexity evaluation. In addition, a 5G reduced capability (RedCap) IoT device is integrated into the (LHM-N) model to support smart city. Finally, the results show that the LHM-N model outperforms the conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) protocol scheme in terms of error rate, latency, and data throughput with reduced energy costs for medium- to high-bandwidth industrial IoT applications. This validates the suitability of the LHM-N model for high data rate IoT applications."",""The authors acknowledge the resources provided by CSIR, Pretoria, and F’SATI at Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, in support of this research."",This research received no external funding.,Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks,,,,2022-12-19,2022,2022-12-19,,11,4,87,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Ogbodo, Emmanuel Utochukwu"; Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M.;" Kurien, Anish M."",""Ogbodo, Emmanuel Utochukwu (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria 0001, South Africa)"; Abu-Mahfouz, Adnan M.

By fitting ray tracing simulation results under different scenarios to the model, the relationships between key parameters in the model and factors including the building density and the transmitter height were qualitatively analysed. Next, we developed a network planning framework for a multi-hop outdoor urban network by formulating a mixed-integer linear programming problem which minimises the overall deployment cost through optimal site selection. Taking the sets of potential site locations and potential links as inputs, we selected a subset of the sites that comprise a tree-structured network that satisfies all the user demands at a minimum deployment cost.

The study of city image communication has become one of the important research directions in the field of communication in recent years. This research mainly discusses the application of 5G virtual reality in the design and dissemination of a contemporary urban image system under the background of big data. This research designs and develops a city image system that models and simulates virtual cities in a three-dimensional scene. The system consists of several different modules, including a data acquisition module, scene construction, and roaming module. The most important data resource formats used by this system are the DXF format and 3DS format, which can be created and acquired using digital stereo images in the data acquisition module. The data import and export module can convert the models in DXF format and 3DS format into Openfligt format models. The model editing and reconstruction module can visually edit and reconstruct the converted model, so that the space and attribute information of the recreated model is stored in the data storage and management system. Finally, a scene roaming module is created, and models are selected from the database to create a 3D city scene and provide interactive roaming information extraction. After the implementation of virtual reality technology, the per capita awareness of urban humanities reached 63.2%. The test results show that because the system integrates the respective advantages of the geographic information system, virtual reality, and database technology, it can better realize the modeling and simulation of digital cities under the conditions of three-dimensional visualization, which is conducive to the spread of urban image."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

We generalize the conventional multiplication table method in a way that the size $T$ of the circular permutation matrix (CPM) can be different from the modulus $M$ in the calculation of the exponent matrix. We classify and suggest the parameters $P\leq M\leq T$ with $M=kP$ so that the resulting codes have girth 8. In particular, we prove the existence of a threshold $T_{0}$ so that the resulting code will always have girth 8 if $T > T_{0}$ is used, given that $M=kP$ .

Therefore, as an alternative method, deterministic models (e.g., ray-tracing models) are widely used for small coverage applications–however, these also require precise 3D digital maps, street structures, and building surface reflection indices, etc. which can be costly and need frequent maintenance. In this paper, an alternative model based on machine learning algorithms is proposed and the algorithms' prediction accuracies are evaluated.

Despite its ease of design and deployment, VoLTE is vulnerable to many sorts of attacks at the control plane's Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which exchanges signaling messages for calls via starting call setups, management, and termination. These SIP attacks may take the form of modified SIP messages that force the SIP devices to restart, or they may take the form of flooding the SIP devices with invite messages, register requests that cause the device to run out of memory, and denying genuine users access to the device. These attacks are commonly known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The SIP register injection attack, which might be injected during the commencement step by SIP equipped devices (SIP smartphones), prior to setting up the Secured Internet Protocol (IPsec) tunnel for the remaining SIP sessions, is of particular relevance, due to its characteristics of exhausting the available bandwidth, memory, and CPU resources, resulting in SIP device failure. Consequently, there is a need to address this difficulty by building an SIP register injection attack detection and mitigation technique. Prior to being processed by the Proxy Call Session Control Function. The proposed scheme verifies each initial register request from User Equipment (UE) at the home network of Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) and compares it to the incoming SIP register request pattern with those stored on the scheme's table (P-CSCF). The proposed technique detects and drops every SIP register request with an abnormal pattern that is associated with an attack. The method proved promising with detection accuracy of over 96.67 percent, which is a solid potential as a preliminary setup towards the creation of a robust Real-time SIP detection and mitigation scheme for 5G networks."",,,KIU Journal of Science Engineering and Technology,,,,2023-04-04,2023,2023-04-04,,2,1,39-44,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""H.

This article proposes a network hardware-in-the-loop (N-HiL) simulation framework to evaluate the impacts of wireless on robot control more efficiently and accurately, and then improve the design by employing correlation analysis between communication and control performances. The N-HiL method provides communication and robot developers with more trustworthy network conditions, while the huge efforts and costs of building and testing the entire physical robot system in real life are eliminated. These benefits are showcased in two representative latency-sensitive applications: 1) safe multirobot coordination for mobile robots, and 2) human-motion-based teleoperation for manipulators. Moreover, we deliver a preliminary assessment of two new-generation wireless technologies, the Wi-Fi6 and 5G, for those applications, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of the N-HiL method as well as the attractiveness of the wireless technologies."",,""This work was supported in part by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research under Grant APR20-0023"; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51975513; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China under Grant LR20E050003; in part by the Major Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51890884;" and in part by the Major Research Plan of Ningbo Innovation 2025 under Grant 2020Z022.

Optimisation of the entire network with learning and distributed intelligence through cognitive-based networks is investigated in the paper. A cognition-based network enhances the capacity for network optimization and designing processes to offer better services to the customers appropriately. With the rapid growth of users, the network distribution channels are required to adopt cognitive-based architecture for optimised capacity, capable of providing secure data transmission to a wider user base. 5G network construction with SDN and NFV, along with AI and machine learning algorithms are considered to be the most efficient cognitive-based approach for network optimisation. The application of NFV helps to develop network functions in operating open hardware platforms, reducing Capex, and OpenX and improving network design efficiently.

With the surging density of devices from millions to billions, unique pilot allocation becomes inapplicable in the user ID-incorporated grant-free random access protocol. Unsourced random access (URA) manifests itself by focusing only on unwrapping the received signals via a common codebook. In this paper, we propose a URA protocol for a massive access cellular system with multi-user single input multiple output (MIMO). The proposed scheme encompasses a codebook enabling construction of sparse transmission frame, a receiver equipped with dictionary learning and error-correcting codes and a collision resolution strategy for the collided codeword. Discrepant to the existing schemes with necessary overhead for preamble signals, no overhead or pre-defined pilot sequences are needed in the proposed scheme, which is favorable for energy-efficient transmission and latency reduction.

A novel method to enumerate all codewords up to a certain Hamming weight for binary linear block codes in general and in particular for the punctured, shortened, precoded polar codes is introduced. The proposed approach performs a recursive decomposition of the codes using construction X4 that is typically used to combine codes of different lengths. This allows to enumerate the low-weight codewords of the overall code as combinations of the low-weight codewords of the component codes. Numerical results show that the proposed approach can efficiently compute the exact partial weight distribution of the 5G New Radio punctured/shortened polar codes with CRC11 and pure polar codes. In the former and latter cases, the low-weight codeword number is up to 106 and 108, respectively.

However, when the number of base station (BS) antenna increases or the number of users is large, it is rather resource-consuming to obtain the CSI. Channel knowledge map (CKM) is an emerging environment-aware wireless communication technology, which stores the physical coordinates of BS and reference locations together with the corresponding channel path information. This makes it possible to obtain CSI with light or even without pilots, which can significantly reduce the overhead of channel estimation and improve system performance, especially suitable for quasi-static wireless environments with relatively stable channels and communication systems using millimeter waves, terahertz waves, visible light, and so on. The main challenge for CKM is how to construct an accurate CKM based on finite measurement data points at limited reference locations. In this work, we proposed a novel CKM construction method based on path matching and environmental partitioning (PMEP-CC) to address the above issues. Specifically, we first sort the propagation paths between reference locations, map them to a high-dimensional space to establish the path correlation coefficient between two reference locations. Then, the communication region are divided into different subregions based on its spatial correlation. Finally, the path information at locations where no measurements are available are estimated based on the known path information within the subregion to construct CKM. Numerical results are provided to show the performance of the proposed method over related studies."",""Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Existing work on IoT mainly focuses on its practical applications, but there is little research on modeling the interactions among components in IoT systems and verifying the correctness of the network deployment. Therefore, the Calculus of the Internet of Things (CaIT) has previously been proposed to formally model and reason about IoT systems. In this paper, the CaIT calculus is extended by introducing broadcast communications. For modeling convenience, we provide explicit operations to model node mobility as well as the interactions between sensors (or actuators) with the environment. To support the use of UPPAAL to verify the temporal properties of IoT networks described by the CaIT calculus, we establish a relationship between timed automata and the CaIT calculus.

Compared with the sub-6G bands, signals transmitted in the millimeter bands suffer from severe channel attenuation. A drone small cell (DSC) has been proposed recently to provide services outdoors. Not only does DSC have high maneuverability, it can also be deployed quickly in the required regions. Therefore, it is an important issue to establish the Air-to-Ground (ATG) channel model by taking into account the effects of building shielding and excess loss in various DSC deployments at different frequency bands. In this paper, we synthesize the ATG channels of the DSC and approximate the excess path loss of the ATG for different urban environments based on the ITU-R standard. With the approximated curve fitting relations, the proper height of the drone base station that satisfies a certain connected probability can be easily obtained for different scenarios."",,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-01-01,2022-01-01,E105.B,1,44-50,Closed,Article,""LI, Chi-Min"; LIAO, Yi-Ting;" WANG, Pao-Jen"",""LI, Chi-Min (Department of Communications, Navigation and Control Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University)"; LIAO, Yi-Ting (Department of Communications, Navigation and Control Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University);" WANG, Pao-Jen (Department of Electrical Engineering, Ming Chi University of Technology)"",,""LI, Chi-Min (National Taiwan Ocean University)"; LIAO, Yi-Ting (National Taiwan Ocean University);" WANG, Pao-Jen (Ming Chi University of Technology)"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139642667,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It also provides upper and lower bounds for these quantities that can be computed efficiently for very long codes. For the binary erasure channel (BEC), we provide a simple method to estimate the mean accurately via density evolution. The analysis shows how to modify, e.g., Reed-Muller codes, to improve the performance when practical list sizes, e.g., $L\in {[{8, 1024}]}$ , are adopted. Exemplary constructions with block lengths $N\in \{128,512\}$ outperform polar codes of 5G over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is further shown that there is a concentration around the mean of the logarithm of the required list size for sufficiently large block lengths, over discrete-output BMS channels. We provide the probability mass functions (p.m.f.s) of this logarithm, over the BEC, for a sequence of the modified RM codes with an increasing block length via simulations, which illustrate that the p.m.f.s concentrate around the estimated mean."",""The authors thank Gerhard Kramer (TUM), an associate editor and an anonymous reviewers for comments improving the presentation.

There are a lot of layout problems in modern engineering and real life, and the indoor space layout is a very important branch. The indoor space layout focuses on the indoor scenes that people rely on for production and life. At the same time, indoor scene models are gradually applied to more and more fields. The urgent need for indoor scene modeling has also led to relevant research on indoor space layout. Because of its wide application prospects and great commercial value, indoor space layout has become an important research topic in the field of computer graphics and computer vision. As the computer-aided design is widely used in the field of intelligent design, indoor space layout has also become an important research field. Focusing on the automatic design and optimization of indoor space layout, this paper proposes an optimization method based on design constraints for the automatic generation of a layout plan based on the given layout boundary or layout space. The room units in the interior space layout are represented by polygons composed of multiple rectangles, and the constraints and rules in the layout design are transformed into constraints on related rectangles.

In Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), vehicles act as connected entities, and exchange data with each other and with the back-end servers on the mobile network. These communications are often session based and require a light weight protocol for session establishment and continuity. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can act as the base for this kind of communication. However, its simplicity also makes the protocol vulnerable to various web attacks such as identity theft and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). As 5G technologies will enable high data rates to the users, this will also exponentially increase the threat of high-speed DDoS on the servers originating from different sources. Thus, appropriate solutions need to be developed for securing SIP systems from these threats. Machine Learning (ML) has transpired as a building block in cyber security solutions, and a large number of techniques are available to make quick and robust network defense systems by automating the identification of attack flows in the network. In this paper, a Deep Learning-based model is proposed for the identification and alleviation of DDoS attacks in SIP based networks. The work presented here uses a system that is scalable and highly available with load balancing and failover addressing capabilities. The datasets used for conducting experiments are created by emulating SIP sessions, generating DDoS attacks, capturing the normal and attack flows, and extracting time window-based features from the packets. A stacked autoencoder model is trained on the curated datasets to detect various types of DDoS attacks. Once an attack is detected, the Mitigation Policy Recommender module recommends various actions for threat mitigation. Performance of the system is assessed in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score. The proposed model obtains a significant improvement in the performance than the previously existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and detection rate."",""This work was funded by CC&amp";"BT, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, and was carried out at Telecommunication Research Lab, University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), Panjab University (PU), Chandigarh, India."",,Mobile Networks and Applications,,,,2022-04-28,2022,2022-04-28,2022-08,27,4,1423-1443,Closed,Article,""Mahajan, Nitish"; Chauhan, Amita; Kumar, Harish; Kaushal, Sakshi;" Sangaiah, Arun Kumar"",""Mahajan, Nitish (UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India)"; Chauhan, Amita (UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India); Kumar, Harish (UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India); Kaushal, Sakshi (UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India); Sangaiah, Arun Kumar (Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India;" National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Douliu, Taiwan)"",""Sangaiah, Arun Kumar (Vellore Institute of Technology University";" National Yunlin University of Science and Technology)"",""Mahajan, Nitish (Panjab University)"; Chauhan, Amita (Panjab University); Kumar, Harish (Panjab University); Kaushal, Sakshi (Panjab University); Sangaiah, Arun Kumar (Vellore Institute of Technology University;" National Yunlin University of Science and Technology)"",9,9,,3.83,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147471244,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here a composite feeding structure excites a dielectric resonator which in tern provides the resonant modes TE 111 , TE 121 , TE 212 , and TE 222 . The dielectric resonator (DR), built of alumina ceramic (ε r, DR = 9.8), is mounted on a fractal triangular patch, inspired by Sierpinski Gasket. The suggested DRA is supported by a FR4 substrate (ε r, sub = 4.4) and measures compactly 40 × 30 × 8.5 mm 3 . To confirm the results of its simulations, the proposed antenna's prototype is prepared and measured up to the second iteration. The measured outcome demonstrates that the suggested antenna has a frequency range of 3.38–10.71 GHz (104%) for S 11 < −10 dB and provides a maximum gain of 7.23 dBi at 8 GHz along with highest possible simulated efficiency of 98%.

It is well known that these integrals arise in the representations of the dyadic Green's functions of layered media and efficient computation of these Green's functions is key to rapid CEM modeling of patch antennas and printed circuits designed for 5G applications in the mm-wave range. The underlying concept of the approach is to partition the spectral domain representation of a Green's function into multiple domains and to represent the envelope of the integrand in each domain with a few exponentials such that the integrals in these domains can be evaluated analytically very efficiently and accurately in a numerically stable manner. Additionally, a new interpolation strategy is proposed in this work to decrease the matrix fill time in the MoM solution of the integral equations whose kernels contain Green's functions mentioned above.

In order to analyze in depth the peculiar characteristics of mm-wave propagation, joint measurement and simulation campaigns in indoor and outdoor microcellular environments have been carried out. The investigation highlights that the assumption that mm-wave NLoS connectivity is hardly feasible is not necessarily true as significant reflections, scattering and even transmission mechanisms can provide good NLoS coverage in the considered indoor and outdoor scenarios. This is also reflected in the limited angle-spread differences between LoS and NLoS locations in some cases. Finally, the contribution of different propagation mechanisms (reflection, diffraction, scattering and combination of them) to the received signal is analyzed in the paper with the help of ray tracing simulations. These outcomes can be helpful to predict the performance of mm-wave wireless systems and for the development of deterministic and geometric-stochastic mm-wave channel models."",,This work was supported in part by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) through the Programme “Dipartimenti di Eccellenza (2018–2022)—Precision Cyberphysical Systems Project (P-CPS)” and in part by the Eu COST Action INTERACT (Intelligence-Enabling Radio Communications for Seamless Inclusive Interactions) under Grant CA20120.,IEEE Open Journal of Antennas and Propagation,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-07-20,2023-01-01,4,,736-747,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Possenti, Leonardo"; Barbiroli, Marina; Vitucci, Enrico M.; Fuschini, Franco; Fosci, Mattia;" Degli-Esposti, Vittorio"",""Possenti, Leonardo (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering “G.

"458,pub.1146159246,10.1088/2631-8695/ac5be7,,,Performance analysis of mmWave radio propagations in an indoor environment for 5G networks,""Existing wireless communications in the sub-6 GHz bands are facing challenges from the growing demand for higher data rates and better quality of services. To satisfy these demands, the fifth generation (5G) mobile network would consider unused spectrum in the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum (30–300 GHz). The shortage of bandwidth in the sub-6 GHz band is solved using mmWave technology. Furthermore, mmWave provides significantly higher throughput, data rate, and capacity. Despite the fact that a huge bandwidth is employed, mmWave technology suffers from diffuse scattering from rough materials, path loss, reflection loss, atmospheric attenuation, building penetration loss, and shadowing which leads to a decrease in the transmitted signal power. Therefore, a reliable and accurate channel model is important in the mmWave bands, particularly for the indoor environment. Moreover, by using technologies like beam-forming and others coupled with mmWave, the listed impairments are minimized. In this work, we analyze the performance of different path loss models (CI, free space, and two rays) at 38, 60, and 73 GHz carrier frequencies in terms of path loss in terms of separation distance between transmitter and receiver. Additionally, we have evaluated the performance of the path loss with respect to the break point distance to enhance the received signal power and throughput. We have also done analysis of the directional power delay profile with received signal power, path loss and path loss exponent (PLE) at 38 GHz and 73 GHz mmWave bands for both LOS and NLOS by using uniform linear array (ULA) 2 × 2 and 64 × 16 antenna configurations using the channel model simulator (NYUSIM). The simulation results show the performance of different path loss models in the mmWave and sub 6 GHz bands. Path loss in the close-in (CI) model at mmWave bands is larger than that of free space and two ray path loss models, because it considers all shadowing and reflection effects between transmitter and receiver."",""Very special thanks to the head of electronics and communication engineering, Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU), Adama, Ethiopia for providing us with an excellent research environment and expert professors who gave us continuous guidance and motivation.

Current researches focus on point-to-point reciprocal-based key extraction from these randomness sources. Most practical communication situations are non-line of sight, so endpoints use a relaying channel to improve communication performance. Besides that, in the upcoming 5G systems, the full-duplex (FD) communications will be one of the main techniques, which will remove the advantage of using the reciprocal feature in the randomness source common observation. In this paper, we consider the challenge of generating a symmetric secret key between two legitimate parties in the relaying channel with FD capability. We suggest an efficient key extraction protocol that accomplished an acceptable shared secret key rate compared to the direct channel traditional approach. Unlike similar schemes, we provide full statistical analysis for the construction of randomness source from the relaying channel with FD capability. Additionally, we investigate the performance analysis of the suggested key agreement protocol.

Model of Two Links,""The evolution of 1G to 4G radio access networks (RANs) over the past 40 years has shown that beamforming (BF) capabilities add an additional spatial dimension to traditional device multiplexing methods. When base stations (gNodeB - gNB) and user equipment (UE) form narrow antenna radiation patterns (APPs), in addition to frequency, time and code division of channels, an additional spatial dimension appears that implements spatial multiplexing. This concept has been known for quite a long time, but the full implementation of its capabilities in practice is expected with the widespread adoption of millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-dense networks (UDN) of the fifth (5G) and subsequent (B5G) generations. To control APP, the approach of preliminary analysis of training sequences about the current situation in the radio channel  - CSI (Channel State Information) - can be used, but its overhead costs become unacceptably high in conditions of ultra-dense distribution of devices. An alternative approach is positioning-based BF. The validity, relevance and prospects of this approach are determined by the fact that for 5G networks, unlike previous generations, for the first time the requirements for UE positioning accuracy up to one meter are formalized. Initial research in the field of location-aware BF has already been carried out over the past years, however, mainly for particular scenarios of one or more radio links between gNBs and fixed UEs. In this work, for the first time, a scientifically based methodology for controlling the beam pattern of a stationary gNB based on the positioning of a mobile UE for a two-radio link scenario is formalized and implemented in software. The problem of practical implementation of BF is the difficulties to predict level of interference due to the mutual influence of radio links with mobile UEs. When estimating the instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio in a two-radio link scenario between two fixed gNBs that perform BF based on the current location of mobile UEs as they move, it is necessary to take into account the mutual influence of each other's radio links on each other. In such a scenario, a transmitter on one radio link acts both as a source of a wanted signal for one UE and as a source of an interfering signal for another UE. The task of assessing interference for such a scenario is complicated by the nonlinearity of the transmitter and/or receiver ARPs. The model developed and implemented in software in this work uses the functions of the Phased Array System Toolbox Matlab extension package. The simulation results show a significant scatter (tens of dB) of the instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio depending on the territorial separation of devices and can be used to justify scenarios for the construction and operation of 5G/B5G UDN."",,,Proceedings of Telecommunication Universities,,,,2023-09-20,2023,2023-09-20,,9,4,44-63,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Fokin, G."",""Fokin, G.

The spectral and spatial degrees of freedom introduce utilization tradeoffs that can be leveraged under different applications. After briefly reviewing the supporting network building elements (emerging fiber types, multiplexers, optical switches, and amplifiers), we consider networking scenarios such as intra/inter datacenter, terrestrial, undersea, and wireless 5G/6G hauling networks and identify the best utilization plan and key attributes that can be harnessed by the offered spectral and spatial degrees of freedom for each scenario and how optical switching can be employed therein for traffic management. Networks supporting these scenarios are experiencing tremendous traffic growth pushing their existing implementations to their physical capacity-distance limits. New network builds must offer significant capacity multipliers in an efficient and cost-effective manner, requiring new switching solutions for supporting the unabated traffic growths foreseen in the years to come.

As a tactful combination of components and structures, three-dimensional (3D) macroscopic absorbents with fascinating synergy afford exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption, and tremendous efforts have been devoted to this investigation. However, in terms of macroscopic absorbents and their synergistic effect, few reviews are proposed to comb the latest achievements and detailed synergy.

The proposed resonators are characterized with square top plates and zigzag arms. All the zigzag arms are inter-coupled in an overlapped fashion, reducing the filter length and specially providing electricalcapacitive (negative) mainline couplings. Owing to the capacitive loadings and large-area square top plates, resonant frequencies can be decreased to very low frequency bands inside a compact size, which further boosts the light-weight application in communication systems. Besides, with the simple construction with only metal structures, this type of filter features low costs. The implementation of both negative and positive cross couplings is also discussed to adapt to the proposed filter configuration, ensuring the flexible placement of transmission zeros (TZs) and the customization of sophisticated filter responses. The good results of a 12-pole Tx filter and a fabricated 10-pole Rx filter have validated the effectivity of the presented structures.

In order to protect privacy while ensuring efficiency, an efficient privacy-preserving framework based on the dimension-aware under spatiotemporal constraints (DSC-EPPF) is proposed. Initially, a novel dimension-aware data preprocessing algorithm under spatiotemporal constraints (DDPA-SC) is designed, which can not only construct the dimension-aware anonymity set, but also lighten the complexity of time. Secondly, a novel candidate anonymity set constructing algorithm with ameliorated peak density clustering (CASA-PDC) is designed, which can resist the background knowledge attack by filtering out redundant anonymity set. Thirdly, the (k, l)-privacy protection algorithm ((k, l)-PPA) is designed for anonymity set construction.

The computation tasks of intelligent applications can be offloaded to and processed by near-end-user MEC servers to meet strict latency requirements. However, the latency of provided services is dependent on MEC processor scheduling and millimeter wave (mmWave) transmission conditions for the urban B5G vehicular networks. To alleviate the mmWave signal attenuation caused by buildings, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been regarded as efficient and prospective infrastructure. In this article, we study the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks and analyze the relationship between computation resource allocation and offloading policy at an intersection. Considering the vehicle mobility patterns, transmission conditions, and task sizes, we optimize the task scheduling by improving the allocation of limited processors and IRS resource. Moreover, the mutual interference among concurrent transmissions is taken into account. Assuming the moving directions available, a dynamic task scheduling algorithm is proposed which considers both the communications and computations. The simulation results illustrate that our proposal outperforms benchmark methods in terms of task offloading rate, computing rate, and finish rate for the IRS-aided MEC-served vehicular networks."",,""This work was supported by the World-leading Innovative and Smart Education program for Artificial Intelligence Electronics, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan."",IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,,,,2022-03-01,2022,2022-03-01,,10,4,1761-1771,Closed,Article,""Zhu, Yishi"; Mao, Bomin;" Kato, Nei"",""Zhu, Yishi (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, 983-0817, Japan)"; Mao, Bomin (National Engineering Laboratory for Integrated Aero-Space-Ground-Ocean Big Data Application Technology, School of Cybersecurity, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China);" Kato, Nei (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, 983-0817, Japan)"",""Mao, Bomin (Northwestern Polytechnical University)"",""Zhu, Yishi (Tohoku University)"; Mao, Bomin (Northwestern Polytechnical University);" Kato, Nei (Tohoku University)"",64,61,,25.43,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145950654,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its vigorous development in recent years has also increased the presence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in people’s lives, and it has been increasingly used in logistics, transportation, photography and other fields. However, the rise in the number of drones has also put pressure on city regulation. Using traditional methods to monitor small objects flying slowly at low altitudes would be costly and ineffective. This study proposed a real-time UAV tracking scheme that uses the 5G network to transmit UAV monitoring images to the cloud and adopted a machine learning algorithm to detect and track multiple targets. Aiming at the difficulties in UAV detection and tracking, we optimized the network structure of the target detector yolo4 (You Only Look Once V4) and improved the target tracker DeepSORT, adopting the detection-tracking mode. In order to verify the reliability of the algorithm, we built a data set containing 3200 pictures of four UAVs in different environments, conducted training and testing on the model, and achieved 94.35% tracking accuracy and 69FPS detection speed under the GPU environment.

We first develop a practical successive integer forcing (IF) scheme based on practical binary codes rather than lattice codes. We then present the successive cancellation integer forcing (SC-IF) scheme, which combines and enhances successive IF and minimum mean squared error successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC). In this scheme, the receiver first decides whether individual decoding or IF sum decoding is appropriate for each data stream, and then conducts successive IF sum decoding only for selected streams while decoding the remaining streams using MMSE-SIC. The proposed SC-IF methodology mitigates the performance loss caused by mismatched IF filtering in fading channels, while attenuating the noise amplification caused by MMSE filtering. Extensive link-level simulations demonstrate that the proposed successive IF significantly improves the basic IF, and the SC-IF improves both the successive IF and MMSE-SIC, offering uniform improvements over conventional linear receivers for most channel correlation and variation parameters and modulation orders at comparable computational costs.

We consider a scenario where new computing requests are continuously generated by a set of devices and are handled through a dynamic queueing system. Building on stochastic optimization tools, we devise a dynamic learning algorithm that jointly optimizes the allocation of radio resources (i.e., power, transmission rates, sleep mode and duty cycle), computation resources (i.e., CPU cycles), and RIS reflectivity parameters (i.e., phase shifts), while guaranteeing a target performance in terms of average end-to-end delay. The proposed strategy enables dynamic control of the system, performing a low-complexity optimization on a per-slot basis while dealing with time-varying radio channels and task arrivals, whose statistics are unknown. The presence and optimization of RISs helps boosting the performance of dynamic MEC, thanks to the capability to shape and adapt the wireless propagation environment.

Anomaly detection in MTS refers to identifying time series which exhibit different behaviors from normal status. Building such a system, however, is challenging due to a few reasons: i) labels for anomaly cases are usually unavailable or very rare";" ii) most existing approaches rely on manual model-design and hyperparameter tuning, which may cost a huge amount of labor effort. To this end, we propose an autonomous anomaly detection technique for multivariate time series data (TimeAutoAD) based on a novel self-supervised contrastive loss. Specifically, we first present an automatic anomaly detection pipeline to optimize the model configuration and hyperparameters automatically. Next, we introduce three different strategies to augment the training data for generating pseudo negative time series and employ a self-supervised contrastive loss to distinguish the original time series and the generated time series. In this way, the representation learning capability of TimeAutoAD can be greatly enhanced and the anomaly detection performance can thus be improved. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TimeAutoAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches but also exhibits robustness when training data are contaminated."",,""The work of Yang Jiao and Kai Yang was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61771013, in part by the Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS), in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds of Shanghai Jiading District."",IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,,,,2022-02-04,2022,2022-02-04,,9,3,1604-1619,Closed,Article,""Jiao, Yang"; Yang, Kai; Song, Dongjing;" Tao, Dacheng"",""Jiao, Yang (Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, China)"; Yang, Kai (Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, China); Song, Dongjing (Deparment of Computer Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, 06269, USA);" Tao, Dacheng (JD Explore Academy in JD.com, Beijing, 100176, China)"",""Yang, Kai (Tongji University)"",""Jiao, Yang (Tongji University)"; Yang, Kai (Tongji University); Song, Dongjing (University of Connecticut);" Tao, Dacheng (Jingdong (China))"",38,33,,16.98,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145281726,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4611 Machine Learning,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, a novel reduced graphene oxide-boron nitride (rGO-BN) hybrid was first designed and fabricated by Michael addition and Schiff base reaction, and then its orientation in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix was regulated by fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology to prepare an efficient polymer-based thermal management material. The results indicated that the preparation of rGO-BN hybrids enabled the synergistic thermal conductivity effect of rGO and BN to be fully exerted. Moreover, the orientation of the filler could be effectively controlled by flexibly regulating the FDM printing methods, thereby promoting the construction of efficient heat conduction paths. Finally, the thermal conductivity of TPU composites reached 2.61 W m−1 K−1, which was 1022% higher than that of pure TPU. In addition, the composite also maintained excellent electrical insulation performance, which further guaranteed its thermal management applications in electronic devices. This work provides a new idea for the design of efficient thermal conductive composites, and further expands the application of 3D printing technology in the field of functional composites."",This study was financially supported by National Key Research and Development Project (2019YFC1908204).,,Composites Science and Technology,,,,2022-08,2022,,2022-08,227,,109591,Closed,Article,""Wang, Shuzhan"; He, Hui; Ye, Xun; Chen, Rubin; Li, Qunyang;" Huang, Bai"",""Wang, Shuzhan (School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510640, China)"; He, Hui (School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510640, China); Ye, Xun (School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510640, China); Chen, Rubin (School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510640, China); Li, Qunyang (School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510640, China);" Huang, Bai (School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510640, China)"",""He, Hui (South China University of Technology)"",""Wang, Shuzhan (South China University of Technology)"; He, Hui (South China University of Technology); Ye, Xun (South China University of Technology); Chen, Rubin (South China University of Technology); Li, Qunyang (South China University of Technology);" Huang, Bai (South China University of Technology)"",18,16,,3.02,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148622999,40 Engineering"; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Deploying slices requires end-to-end (E2E) control of services and the underlying resources in a network substrate featuring an increasing number of stakeholders. Beyond the technical difficulties this entails, there is a long list of administrative negotiations among parties that do not necessarily trust each other, which often requires costly manual processes, including the legal construction of neutral entities. In this context, Blockchain comes to the rescue by bringing its decentralized yet immutable and auditable lemdger, which has a high potential in the telco arena. In this sense, it may help to automate some of the above costly processes. There have been some proposals in this direction that are applied to various problems among different stakeholders. This paper aims at structuring this field of knowledge by, first, providing introductions to network slicing and blockchain technologies. Then, state-of-the-art is presented through a global architecture that aggregates the various proposals into a coherent whole while showing the motivation behind applying Blockchain and smart contracts to network slicing.

" With the prosperous development of wearable electronics, flexible radio-frequency wireless antenna sensors have attracted considerable interest due to their various applications in the Internet of things (IoT). However, vital issues including device configurations and materials restricted the miniaturization and flexibility of antenna sensors. In this work, we demonstrated a microstrip antenna wireless sensor consisting of a copper ground plane, a polydimethylsiloxane dielectric substrate and an MXene patch. Our optimized device possessed a small size (40 × 40 mm 2 ) with a resonant frequency at 4.8 GHz and a frequency-shift range of 8% under different strains and matches well with 5G communications. Moreover, our antenna wireless sensor exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility and stable response to repetitive stimulations. The strain sensitivity of 20 is also impressive among similar antenna sensors. The demonstrations on human body and cantilever motion monitoring were conducted with desirable stability and sensitivity, where the sensor showed obvious shifted resonant frequencies while the reflection coefficient was maintained at around −25 dB, revealing its great potential in healthcare monitoring, construction diagnosis and IoT."",This work was financially supported by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (Grant No. KQTD20200820113045083 and ZDSYS20190902093220279).,,Materials Advances,,,,2023-02-06,2023,2023,2023-02-06,4,3,917-922,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Yin, Ao";

"440,pub.1157666867,10.1016/j.carbon.2023.118075,,,Recent advancements in carbonaceous nanomaterials for multifunctional broadband electromagnetic interference shielding and wearable devices,""The ever-increasing proliferation of 5G wireless communication technologies and modern electronics gadgets raises concerns about electromagnetic pollution. Among the myriad e-pollution, electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a recently emphasized realm with much more implications. It affects the performance including malfunctioning and has negative impact on organisms and ecosystems. Therefore, multi-functional EMI shielding materials are essential for minimizing electromagnetic pollution and protecting human beings as well as the nearby devices or systems. In this regard, carbonaceous materials are considered as promising for efficient EMI shielding and microwave absorber due to their synergistic loss mechanism as well as the tunable architecture design. Recent progress revealed that there is significant attention in the construction of carbonaceous material with a unique multiple-interface (i.e. multi-layer, core-shell) framework. More impressively, the multilayer strategic approach is able to relocate the EMI shielding mechanism from reflection to absorption. It generates a significant number of heterogeneous interfaces among the various EM constituents resulting increased interfacial polarisation and dielectric loss. The progress of heterogeneous interface material is endless and this novel class of materials is widely used in various wearable devices and radiation source. Finally, the challenges and prospects on the development of carbon-based multiple-interfaces composites are discussed in detail."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Naresh Chandra Murmu reports financial support, administrative support, and writing assistance were provided by Council of Scientific Industrial Research.

The full 3-D patterns of all antenna elements in the array need to be characterized because they are in general different due to construction inaccuracy, coupling, antenna array’s asymmetry, etc. The effective aperture distribution function (EADF) can provide an analytic description of an antenna array based on a full-sphere measurement of the array in an anechoic chamber. However, as the array aperture increases, denser spatial samples are needed for EADF due to large distance offsets of array elements from the reference point in the anechoic chamber, leading to a prohibitive measurement time and increased complexity of EADF. In this article, we present the EADF applied to large-scale arrays and highlight issues caused by the large array aperture. To overcome the issues, an enhanced EADF is proposed with a low complexity that is intrinsically determined by the characteristic of each array element rather than the array aperture. The enhanced EADF is validated using experimental measurements conducted at 27–30 GHz frequency band with a relatively large planar array."",The authors would like to thank Martin Nilsson for his assistance in preparing the measurement setup.,""This work was supported in part by the Horizon Europe Framework Program under the Marie Skodowska-Curie under Grant 101059091"; in part by the Swedish Research Council under Grant 2022-04691;" in part by the Strategic Research Area Excellence Center at Linköping — Lund in Information Technology (ELLIIT), Excellence Center at Link Ping Lund in Information Technology, and in part by under the Fordonsstrategisk Forskning och Innovation (FFI) Simulation and Verification of Wireless Technologies 2 (SIVERT 2) Project Supported by VINNOVA, Sweden’s Innovation Agency, and Ericsson."",IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,,,,2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,2023-08-01,71,8,6869-6877,All OA";" Green,Article,""Cai, Xuesong"; Zhu, Meifang; Fedorov, Aleksei;" Tufvesson, Fredrik"",""Cai, Xuesong (Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, 22100, Lund, Sweden)"; Zhu, Meifang (Ericsson AB, 22362, Lund, Sweden); Fedorov, Aleksei (Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, 22100, Lund, Sweden);" Tufvesson, Fredrik (Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, 22100, Lund, Sweden)"",""Cai, Xuesong (Lund University)"",""Cai, Xuesong (Lund University)"; Zhu, Meifang (Ericsson (Sweden)); Fedorov, Aleksei (Lund University);" Tufvesson, Fredrik (Lund University)"",9,9,,6.99,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11483,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159937320,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The BAU alone can have a very wide operating band of larger than 4 GHz (about 3.25-7.40 GHz, a fractional bandwidth of about 78%). Owing to the antenna’s dual shorting metal walls, it allows arbitrary antenna units to be directly connected in series into a linear patch array with high port isolation (>20 dB) over the very wide band, with no additional decoupling elements required. A four-antenna LPA constructed by using four BAUs is demonstrated. In addition to the high port isolation, the four-antenna LPA can generate four uncorrelated waves with their measured envelope correlation coefficients (ECCs) less than 0.03 over the very wide band almost same as that of the BAU alone. In addition, the proposed MIMO LPA has an all-metal structure, with no substrate materials required. The obtained results make it promising for MIMO access-point application to cover the 5G band of 3.3-5.0 GHz and the unlicensed or mobile band of 5.925-7.125 GHz. Details of the BAU-based wideband multi-antenna MIMO LPA and the experimental results of the four-antenna LPA are presented."",,""This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant MOST 110-2224-E-110-001 and Grant MOST 109-2221-E-110-059."",IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-04-29,2022-01-01,10,,46302-46311,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Wong, Kin-Lu"; Yan, Guan-Lin;" Li, Wei-Yu"",""Wong, Kin-Lu (Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan)"; Yan, Guan-Lin (Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, 80424, Taiwan);" Li, Wei-Yu (Information and Communications Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, 31057, Taiwan)"",""Wong, Kin-Lu (National Sun Yat-sen University)"",""Wong, Kin-Lu (National Sun Yat-sen University)"; Yan, Guan-Lin (National Sun Yat-sen University);" Li, Wei-Yu (Industrial Technology Research Institute)"",5,3,,2.6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9668973/09765463.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147499671,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To meet the requirements of high-performance applications, several AEADs make use of AES New Instructions (AES-NI), which can conduct operations of AES encryption and decryption dramatically fast by hardware accelerations. At SAC 2013, Wu and Preneel proposed an AES-based AEAD scheme called AEGIS-128/128L/256, to achieve high-speed software implementation. At FSE 2016, Jean and Nikolić generalized the construction of AEGIS and proposed more efficient round functions. At ToSC 2021, Sakamoto et al. further improved the constructions of Jean and Nikolić, and proposed an AEAD scheme called Rocca for beyond 5G. In this study, we first evaluate the security of the initialization phases of Rocca and AEGIS family against differential and integral attacks using MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) tools. Specifically, according to the evaluation based on the lower bounds for the number of active S-boxes, the initialization phases of AEGIS-128/128L/256 are secure against differential attacks after 4/3/6 rounds, respectively. Regarding integral attacks, we present the integral distinguisher on 6 rounds and 6/5/7 rounds in the initialization phases of Rocca and AEGIS-128/128L/256, respectively. Besides, we evaluate the round function of Rocca and those of Jean and Nikolić as cryptographic permutations against differential, impossible differential, and integral attacks. Our results indicate that, for differential attacks, the growth rate of increasing the number of active S-boxes in Rocca is faster than those of Jean and Nikolić. For impossible differential and integral attacks, we show that the round function of Rocca achieves the sufficient level of the security against these attacks in smaller number of rounds than those of Jean and Nikolić."",,,IEICE Transactions on Fundamentals of Electronics Communications and Computer Sciences,,,,2023-03-01,2023,2023-03-01,2023-03-01,E106.A,3,253-262,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""TAKEUCHI, Nobuyuki"; SAKAMOTO, Kosei;" ISOBE, Takanori"",""TAKEUCHI, Nobuyuki (Graduate School of Information Science, University of Hyogo)"; SAKAMOTO, Kosei (Graduate School of Applied Informatics, University of Hyogo); ISOBE, Takanori (Graduate School of Information Science, University of Hyogo; Graduate School of Applied Informatics, University of Hyogo; National Institute of Information and Communications Technology;" PRESTO, Japan Science and Technology Agency)"",,""TAKEUCHI, Nobuyuki (University of Hyogo)"; SAKAMOTO, Kosei (University of Hyogo); ISOBE, Takanori (University of Hyogo; University of Hyogo; National Institute of Information and Communications Technology;" Japan Science and Technology Agency)"",1,1,,0.81,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/transfun/E106.A/3/E106.A_2022CIP0013/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152589162,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is critical to develop electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with remarkable shielding effectiveness along with lightweight and flexible properties, while the integrations of the heat management performances have been gradually indispensable, especially in wearable electronic device applications. Anchoring the Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets on the surfaces of the recycled carbon fibers (RCF) and assembling heterostructure can be regarded as effective strategies, while simultaneously solving the conductivity reduction and the corresponding performance degradation bottlenecks of the thermal-recycling carbon fiber. The construction of the RCF-MXene paper performs remarkable EMI shielding performance of 45.7 dB, while the specific SE/t can be improved to 7723.85 dB cm2 g- 1, along with impressive photothermal and electrothermal conversion abilities. After coating PDMS layers, the flexible RCF-MXene@PDMS film maintains stable EMI shielding performance when experiencing in-situ electrothermal conversion and after 10000-cycle mechanical deformation processes.

HAPS can provide mobile communication services directly to the existing smartphones commonly used in terrestrial mobile communication networks such as Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE), and in the near future, Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR). In order to design efficient HAPS-based cell configurations, we need a radio wave propagation model that takes into consideration factors such as terrain, vegetation, urban areas, suburban areas, and building entry loss. In this paper, we propose a new vegetation loss model for Recommendation ITU-R P.833-9 that can take transmission frequency and seasonal characteristics into consideration. It is based on measurements and analyses of the vegetation loss of deciduous trees in different seasons in Japan. Also, we carried out actual stratospheric measurements in the 700MHz band in Kenya to extend the lower frequency limit. Because the measured results show good agreement with the results predicted by the new vegetation loss model, the model is sufficiently valid in various areas including actual HAPS usage."",,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,2022-10-01,2022,2022-10-01,2022-10-01,E105.B,10,1209-1218,Closed,Article,""OMOTE, Hideki"; Akihiro, SATO; KIMURA, Sho; TANAKA, Shoma;" LIN, HoYu"",""OMOTE, Hideki (SoftBank Corp)"; Akihiro, SATO (SoftBank Corp); KIMURA, Sho (SoftBank Corp); TANAKA, Shoma (SoftBank Corp);" LIN, HoYu (SoftBank Corp)"",,""OMOTE, Hideki (SoftBank Group (Japan))"; Akihiro, SATO (SoftBank Group (Japan)); KIMURA, Sho (SoftBank Group (Japan)); TANAKA, Shoma (SoftBank Group (Japan));" LIN, HoYu (SoftBank Group (Japan))"",1,0,,0.52,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147055460,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reactive nature of existing management systems is a bottleneck, and it can be solved by building proactive systems that exploit temporal characteristics of time-series mobility data to predict long-term user movement (i.e., path). However, user mobile path prediction with useable accuracy is a challenging task, particularly for lengthy target trajectories. This paper adopts general approaches to propose two models for predicting mobile path with high accuracy. Step Forward Iteration (SFI) model is based on recursive approach, whereas Encoder-Decoder (ED) model follows multi-output approach, and both the models use Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the learning unit. Training and testing of these models is done on mobility datasets from the wireless network of Pangyo ICT Research Center, Korea and one of the Korean mobile operators. The experiment results show viability of the proposed models for leveraging mobile network management, as they outperform state-of-the-art GRU with attention (GRU-ATTN) and Transformer Network (TN) models.

In urban intersection scenario, obstacles such as buildings and road side installations/signboards block the line-of-sight communication between vehicles. In order to enhance the reliability of communication link, the existing vehicular solution utilizes relay placement at road intersection. However, as the vehicular density increases, the existing vehicular-radio frequency (V-RF) communication with relaying tends to suffer from higher interference, lower packet reception rate, and longer communication delays due to channel congestion. In contrast to the existing solutions, we propose to use practical deployment strategies namely hybrid vehicular-visible light communication (V-VLC)/V-RF with relaying and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided V-RF solutions to improve the communication range for urban vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We present stochastic geometry based analytical framework to analyze the performance of proposed solutions in terms of outage probability, throughput and delay outage rate (DOR). Numerical results illustrate that the proposed solutions can achieve considerable performance improvement in outage, throughput while ensuring low latency as compared to conventional V-RF with relaying. These deployment strategies may also serve as a preferred alternative for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to meet ultra-high reliable and ultra-low latency communication for beyond 5 G (B5G) vehicular networks."",""This publication is an outcome of the research and development (RD) work undertaken project under the Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme of Ministry of Electronics Information Technology, Government of India, being implemented by Digital India Corporation."",,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2022-05-10,2022,2022-05-10,,71,8,8137-8151,Closed,Article,""Singh, Gurinder"; Srivastava, Anand;" Bohara, Vivek Ashok"",""Singh, Gurinder (Wirocomm Research Group, IIIT-Delhi, New Delhi, 110020, India)"; Srivastava, Anand (Wirocomm Research Group, IIIT-Delhi, New Delhi, 110020, India);" Bohara, Vivek Ashok (Wirocomm Research Group, IIIT-Delhi, New Delhi, 110020, India)"",""Singh, Gurinder (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi)"",""Singh, Gurinder (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi)"; Srivastava, Anand (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi);" Bohara, Vivek Ashok (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi)"",32,26,,14.56,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147783442,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Herein, the polydopamine (PDA) and silver (Ag) modified BN (BN-PDA-Ag) was synthesized and a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected BN-PDA-Ag porous network was successfully fabricated by the salt template-assisted method to improve the thermal conductivity property of epoxy based composites. The high thermal conductive epoxy resin composites (3D BN-PDA-Ag/EP) were obtained by infiltrating epoxy into the 3D BN-PDA-Ag porous network. On one hand, the 3D BN-PDA-Ag porous skeleton provided continuous transfer paths for phonons, which was conducive to reducing phonon scattering. On the other hand, the Ag nanoparticles loaded on the BN surface bridged the adjacent BN sheets, significantly decreasing the thermal contact resistance between adjacent fillers. The isotropic thermal conductivity (TC) of 3D BN-PDA-Ag/EP composite with a BN-PDA-Ag content of 20.3 wt% reached 1.37 W/(m·K), which exhibited a evident enhancement of 661% compared with pure epoxy.

With 5G building upon and working together with 4G, it promises up to 100 times faster connectivity than 4G, greater bandwidth and extremely low latency. Though this dramatically enhances user experience, it calls for densification of the network by deploying smaller cells. This solution significantly improves network coverage but results in frequent handoffs. With the adoption of newer network technologies, potential new threats are introduced which becomes quite challenging for the industry. For ensuring seamless mobility, an effective handoff mechanism should ensure a secure and fast authentication process. In this article, Deep Sparse Stacked Autoencoder Network (DS2AN), an unsupervised deep learning model has been used to achieve the said objective. In the proposed method, training is done based on number of hidden layers using back propagation algorithm. Once trained, the cost function is minimized in order to achieve fine tuning of DS2AN.Compared with the existing handoff schemes, DS2AN promises a better level of security and a reduction in time required for handoff. Also, DS2AN is used to identify the presence of malicious entities thereby increasing security in the network. The performance of DS2AN algorithm for authentication delay has been evaluated based on communication and computational cost, and the results shows that DS2AN performs better compared to existing techniques."",,,Security and Privacy,,,,2022-01-11,2022,2022-01-11,2022-05,5,3,,Closed,Article,""Hemavathi"; Akhila, S.; Zubeda, Samreen;" Shashidhara, R."",""Hemavathi (Department of Electronics and Communication, B.M.S.

The types of uplink interference from base stations have grown significantly, and they will be affected by more than one type. It will be difficult to identify the uplink compound interference for the network operator. Meanwhile, the same interference type has flexible frequency location and variable frequency bandwidth. For multiple interference source cases, the classification accuracy and generalization ability of traditional algorithms cannot meet the needs of the actual production environment. Therefore, this paper proposes the FETTrans network to transform the compound interference identification task into a multi-label classification in natural language processing. Inspired by the attention mechanism in Transformer and combined with the pattern recognition task, the correlation between the constructed output vector and input features is obtained through the attention mechanism. On this basis, the network transforms the unidirectional static projection method into a bidirectional dynamic adaptation method, which effectively improves the identification accuracy of the variable compound interference frequency band. After verification by different test sets collected from the current network, the classification accuracy has steadily increased by more than 15%, and the mAP has reached 92%.

Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) technology is rekindling corporate interest as 5G and 6G technologies take off. The absence of a reliable functional testing approach is one of the main issues with current technology. Currently, testing scenario libraries are created manually by testers, which has the drawback of being scarce and ineffective. Traditional automated generating algorithms provide limited-coverage scenarios that do not account for the influence of sensors. Our contributions to solving these issues are as follows. First, we extract the roads in the research region from OpenStreetMap (OSM), filter them, and annotate them using hierarchical clustering of feature values, which creates a static road library. Second, reinforcement learning is used to model dynamic situations using a partly observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in conjunction with sensor inputs. The creation process can be run concurrently with functional tests. Third, the efficiency of simulation testing is increased by integrating the static road library and the dynamic scenario section to produce a sizable library of test scenarios. This increases the realism and coverage of the library.

First, Lyapunov optimization is leveraged to decouple the long‐term service priority constraint and short‐term access management optimization, and decompose the long‐term stochastic optimization problem into a series of short‐term deterministic problems. Then, a priority‐aware deep Q‐network (DQN)‐based fast uplink grant access management (PDAC) algorithm is proposed to achieve intelligent access management with differentiated service priority requirements. PDAC utilizes DQN to handle non‐convex high‐dimensional optimization problem with service priority constraint to achieve intelligent access management and priority awareness. Simulation results demonstrate that PDAC outperforms the existing algorithms in access queuing delay, buffer queue backlog, and priority deficit fluctuation."",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China under grant 52094021N010 (5400‐202199534A‐0‐5‐ZN).

In this context, virtual clothing shops and fitted clothing have also started to appear online and people have a new platform to choose their clothing. In the development of the clothing industry, e-tailoring will become a new trend, and if we look at the clothing industry as a whole, e-tailoring is bound to develop rapidly, as it is now difficult for people to find clothes they are happy with on the shelves. However, many clothing shops on online platforms are now able to provide a more limited service to people, making it difficult for consumers to buy the right clothes for them, and the situation of returns is more serious. So many consumers are still more willing to buy clothes in the physical shop"; if we can use the virtual reality environment of three-dimensional clothing design, consumers in the online clothing shop can freely choose their favorite clothing, and then the selected clothing considers the proposed wear in accordance with the size of the consumer production of the human body virtual model to observe the three-dimensional effect so that consumers can choose more suitable clothing. This paper mainly studies the 3D clothing design method in the computer 5G virtual reality environment. In the context of the computer 5G era, this article discusses the characteristics of virtual reality technology in detail and proposes a modeling method for 3D clothing design based on virtual reality.

Single Base Station (BS) positioning has become popular for its fast speed, high convenience, and low cost. With the construction of 5G, the wide bandwidth and high separation capability of millimeter Wave (mmWave) bring more possibilities for vehicle positioning via single BS. However, mmWave signals have high distance attenuation and are easily blocked by obstacles. In urban scenarios, the prevalent None-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) situations have severe impacts on positioning accuracy. The multipath effects, Doppler effects, and tracking lags further degrade the performance. To address these issues, we introduce the Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) to single BS vehicle positioning for beyond Line-of-Sight (LoS) communications. We study the advantages of IRS in urban ITS to alleviate the multipath effects, Doppler effects, and tracking delay. To realize the real-time target tracking for IRS, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is adopted, for which stable communications between the BS and moving vehicle can be maintained. Simulation results show that the utilization of IRS can significantly improve the positioning accuracy and the adoption of UKF further enhances the performance."",,""This work was supported in part by the World-Leading Innovative and Smart Education Program for Artificial Intelligence Electronics, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, Japan."",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,2023-10-09,2023,2023-10-09,2024-01-01,42,1,68-77,Closed,Article,""Zhu, Yishi"; Mao, Bomin;" Kato, Nei"",""Zhu, Yishi (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, 983-0817, Japan)"; Mao, Bomin (National Engineering Laboratory for Integrated Aero-Space-Ground-Ocean Big Data Application Technology, School of Cybersecurity, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, Shaanxi, 710072, China; Yangtze River Delta Research Institute, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Taicang, Jiangsu, 215400, China);" Kato, Nei (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, 983-0817, Japan)"",""Mao, Bomin (Northwestern Polytechnical University";" Northwestern Polytechnical University)"",""Zhu, Yishi (Tohoku University)"; Mao, Bomin (Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University);" Kato, Nei (Tohoku University)"",13,13,,7.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164804579,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A Throughput-Complexity Analysis for OFDM Signals,""In this paper, we study the impact of computational complexity on the throughput limits of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. Based on the spectro-computational complexity (SC) analysis, we verify that the complexity of an $N$ -point FFT grows faster than the number of bits in the OFDM symbol. Thus, we show that FFT nullifies the OFDM throughput on $N$ unless the $N$ -point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) problem verifies as $\Omega (N)$ , which remains a “fascinating” open question in theoretical computer science. Also, because FFT demands $N$ to be a power of two $2^{i}$ ($i>0$ ), the spectrum widening leads to an exponential complexity on $i$ , i.e. $O(2^{i}i)$ . To overcome these limitations, we consider the alternative frequency-time transform formulation of vector OFDM (V-OFDM), in which an $N$ -point FFT is replaced by $N/L$ ($L > 0$ ) smaller $L$ -point FFTs to mitigate the cyclic prefix overhead of OFDM. Building on that, we replace FFT by the straightforward DFT algorithm to release the V-OFDM parameters from growing as powers of two and to benefit from flexible numerology (e.g., $L=3$ , $N=156$ ). Besides, by setting $L$ to $\Theta (1)$ , the resulting solution can run linearly on $N$ (rather than exponentially on $i$ ) while sustaining a non null throughput as $N$ grows."",,""This work was supported in part by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), through the Regional Operational Program of Centre (CENTRO 2020) of the Portugal 2020 framework and FCT under the MIT Portugal Program (Project SNOB-5G with Nr. 045929), under Grant CENTRO-01-0247-FEDER-045929"; in part by the Project POWER, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER), through Portugal 2020 (PT2020), under Grant POCI-01-0247-FEDER-070365;" and in part by the Competitiveness and Internationalization Operational Program (COMPETE 2020)."",IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-09-28,2022-01-01,10,,104436-104448,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Queiroz, Saulo"; Vilela, João P.;" Monteiro, Edmundo"",""Queiroz, Saulo (Academic Department of Informatics, Federal University of Technology (UTFPR), 84017-220, Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil"; Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra (CISUC), Department of Informatics Engineering, University of Coimbra, 3030-290, Coimbra, Portugal); Vilela, João P.

In addition, in the era when 5G and future 6G networks gradually realize the interconnection of everything, the Information-Centric Internet of Things (IC-IoT) based on ICN architecture has emerged, and a large number of IoT devices can use ICN nodes as edge devices to realize collaborative caching.

Mobile wireless networks in smart cities provide people with ubiquitous network services, thereby making the entire city organic. However, the open character of such wireless networks results in network security issues. As a result, people suffer from potential network threats while enjoying the convenience of wireless networks. To solve this problem, various roaming authentication protocols for mobile network are proposed. We find that a contradiction exists between user anonymity and resistance to denial of service (DoS) attacks. Most current protocols attach importance to user privacy protection. Hence, they are vulnerable to DoS attacks, which cause network paralysis. We put forward an anonymous authentication protocol with DoS resistance for smart cities by overcoming the defects of the protocol of Xie et al. Then, two formal validation tools, namely, ProVerif and BAN logic, are introduced to verify the security of our scheme. Security analyses indicate that our protocol not only meets many known security properties but also shows higher efficiency compared with related works. In addition, the proposed protocol achieves a good balance between user anonymity and DoS attack resistance, while many other schemes failed to do so because they ignore this type of attack. Thus, it is more suitable for smart cities."",This work was supported in part by the General Project of Education Department in Sichuan under Grants 18ZB0485.,,Wireless Networks,,,,2022-01-27,2022,2022-01-27,2022-02,28,2,745-763,Closed,Article,""Chen, Rui"; Mou, Yongcong;" Zhang, Min"",""Chen, Rui (College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, 610066, Chengdu, China)"; Mou, Yongcong (Sichuan Water Conservancy Vocational College, 611231, Chengdu, China);" Zhang, Min (College of Foreign Language, Southwest Minzu University, 610225, Chengdu, China)"",""Chen, Rui (Sichuan Normal University)"",""Chen, Rui (Sichuan Normal University)"; Mou, Yongcong (Sichuan Water Conservancy Vocational College, 611231, Chengdu, China);" Zhang, Min (Southwest Minzu University)"",5,5,,2.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145018845,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As part of this implementation, one of the challenges that must be addressed is the skip-zone problem, which occurs when objects such as trees, people, animals, and vehicles obstruct the transmission of signals. In free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) systems, dead zones are most often caused by buildings and trees, while in visible light communications (VLC), obstructions are caused by individuals moving around a room or objects placed in the room. A signal obstruction can significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio in RF and indoor VLC systems, whereas in FSO systems, where the transmitted signals are directional, the obstruction can completely disrupt data transmission. Therefore, the skip-zone dilemma must be resolved to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of 5G and beyond networks. By placing a relay between a transmitter and a receiver, the effects of obstacles can be mitigated. As a result, the signal from the transmitter will reach the receiver. In recent years, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that are more efficient than relays have become widely accepted as a method of mitigating skip-zones and providing reconfigurable radio environments. However, there have been limited studies of RISs for optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. Through the RIS technology, OWC and RF communication channels can be reconfigured. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial on indoor VLC systems utilizing RIS technology. The article discusses the basics of VLC and RISs and reintroduces RISs for OWC systems, focusing on RIS-assisted indoor VLC systems. We also provide a comprehensive overview of optical RISs and examine the differences between optical RISs, RF-RISs, and optical relays. Furthermore, we discuss in detail how RISs can be used to overcome line-of-sight blockages and the device orientation issue in VLC systems while revealing key challenges such as RIS element orientation design, RIS elements to access point/user assignment design, and RIS array positioning design problems that need to be studied. Moreover, we discuss and propose several research problems on integrating optical RISs with other emerging technologies, including non-orthogonal multiple access, multiple-input multiple-output systems, physical layer security, and simultaneous lightwave and power transfer in VLC systems. Finally, we highlight other important research directions that can further improve the performance of RIS-assisted VLC systems."",,This work was supported in part by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through its Discovery Program"; in part by the Memorial University VPR Program; and in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant CNS-2128448.,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,,,,2022-12-01,2022,2022-12-01,2023-01-01,25,1,251-288,All OA;" Bronze,Article,""Aboagye, Sylvester"; Ndjiongue, Alain R.; Ngatched, Telex M.

By mapping the knowledge base of 103 papers on intelligent ports, retrieved in late December 2022 from the Web of Science, this study conducted a roadmapping exercise using knowledge mapping findings, assisted by Bibliometrix, VoSviewer, and customized Python scripts. The three structural (intellectual, social, and conceptual) aspects of knowledge structure reveal the significance of the internet of things (IoT), the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), digitalization and supply chains, and the need for digital transformation alignment across various stakeholders with Industry 4.0 practices. Furthermore, an even geographical distribution and institutional representation was observed across major continents. The results of the analysis of the conceptual structure demonstrated the existence of several established and emerging clusters of research, namely (1) industry data, IoT, and ICT, (2) industry 4.0, (3) smart airports, (4) automation";" and (5) protocol and security. The overall empirical findings revealed the underlying technology and innovation management issues of digital transformation alignment across stakeholders in IoT, Industry 4.0, 5G, Big Data, and AI integrated solutions.

However, the creation of digital twins requires the processing of an enormous amount of data, thereby leading to an increase in mobile network traffic. This traffic is produced by applications in user devices and city services, which engage in local consumption at the city scale through sensor and camera devices using mobile networks. Such increased traffic can compromise the communication speed and stability. To alleviate this burden, traffic offloading becomes a crucial consideration in the beyond-5G era. This paper presents a scheme known as Area-Controlled Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (AMoND). AMoND uses a hierarchical structure of a location layer and an ad-hoc layer to construct area-controlled mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for mutual support of the digital twin and MANETs. AMoND effectively suppresses mobile network traffic by harnessing the digital twin to assist the MANETs during data collection for the digital twin construction. Importantly, the digital twin used in AMoND focuses on the management of node location information and does not need to reproduce the real space on a computer fully. AMoND is not dependent on a specific MANET protocol and can be used as an add-on. AMoND exhibits the ability to reduce traffic volumes by up to approximately 65%, while maintaining arrival rates that are comparable to existing MANET protocols under certain conditions."",,This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI under Grant JP21H04886 and Grant JP21K17734.,IEEE Access,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-08-11,2023-01-01,11,,85224-85236,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Ono, Shota"; Yamazaki, Taku; Miyoshi, Takumi; Taya, Akihito; Nishiyama, Yuuki;" Sezaki, Kaoru"",""Ono, Shota (Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 153-8505, Japan)"; Yamazaki, Taku (College of Systems Engineering and Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Saitama, 337-8570, Japan); Miyoshi, Takumi (Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 153-8505, Japan; College of Systems Engineering and Science, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Saitama, 337-8570, Japan); Taya, Akihito (Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 153-8505, Japan); Nishiyama, Yuuki (Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, 277-8568, Japan); Sezaki, Kaoru (Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 153-8505, Japan;" Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo, Chiba, 277-8568, Japan)"",""Ono, Shota (The University of Tokyo)"",""Ono, Shota (The University of Tokyo)"; Yamazaki, Taku (Shibaura Institute of Technology); Miyoshi, Takumi (The University of Tokyo; Shibaura Institute of Technology); Taya, Akihito (The University of Tokyo); Nishiyama, Yuuki (The University of Tokyo); Sezaki, Kaoru (The University of Tokyo;" The University of Tokyo)"",6,6,,4.33,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10214544.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163228661,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The RF and microwave (MW) technologies developed for the deployment of these communication systems exploit devices whose dimension is now well below 100 nm, featuring an increasing variability due to the fabrication process tolerances and the inherent statistical behavior of matter at the nanoscale. In this scenario, variability analysis must be incorporated into circuit design and optimization, with ad hoc models retaining a direct link to the fabrication process and addressing typical MMIC nonlinear applications like power amplification and frequency mixing. This paper presents a flexible procedure to extract black-box models from accurate physics-based simulations, namely TCAD analysis of the active devices and EM simulations for the passive structures, incorporating the dependence on the most relevant fabrication process parameters. We discuss several approaches to extract these models and compare them to highlight their features, both in terms of accuracy and of ease of extraction. We detail how these models can be implemented into EDA tools typically used for RF and MMIC design, allowing for fast and accurate statistical and yield analysis.

First, we propose a self-multipath counteraction method by building multiple coupling paths on the radiating branch of one of the antennas, where the coupling energy passing through the multiple coupling paths could be counteracted at the feeding ports. Based on this principle, two types of single-band self-multipath decoupled antenna pairs are constructed with the shorted end and the open end without using any additional decoupling structures. Then, a dual-band and wideband self-multipath decoupled antenna pair is designed by combining the multipath of such two types of single-band self-multipath decoupled antenna pairs. Finally, a four-band and wideband self-multipath decoupled antenna pair is constructed to further widen the decoupling bandwidth based on the dual-band self-multipath decoupled antenna pair. Both simulated and measured results show that the four-band antenna pair can be self-decoupled at four bands with the isolation more than 20 dB over entire N77, N78, and N79 bands, demonstrating excellent multiband and wideband self-decoupling performance.

Several transparent materials and techniques are used for transparent antenna design. Thin-film and mesh-grid techniques are very popular to transform metallic parts of the antenna into a transparent material.

Compromised IoT devices can result in the exposure of user privacy, damage to network security, or even threats to personal safety. In a rush for convenience and marketability, the security of these devices is usually less considered during production and even ignored. Under these circumstances, Remote Attestation (RA) becomes a valuable security service. It outsources the computation and verification burden to a resource-rich party, e.g., server, to ease its on-device implementation, making it suitable for protocol extensions. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-the-art RA schemes from different perspectives, aiming to offer a comprehensive understanding of this security service. Specifically, we summarize the basis of RA. We set up an elaborate adversarial model by systematizing existing RA schemes. Then we put forward the evaluation criteria from protection capability, performance, network adaptability, and attestation quality.

Nowadays, the vast majority of electronic devices benefits from digital signal processing to implement more and more functionalities, which can be further enhanced by the action of AI algorithms and artefacts. Moreover, as the analog/digital interfaces are moving closer and closer to the point where the information is either acquired or transmitted, the so-called AI-managed data converters are becoming key building blocks in an increasingly number of interconnected cyberphysical systemsmade up of both software and hardware components. Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Cognitive Radio (CR) systems intended for 5G/6G communications are good examples which can benefit from an early digitization managed by AI engines. In this context, this paper presents an overview of circuits and systems techniques for AI-managed analog/digital interfaces with application in SDR/CR mobile telecom systems.

They offer low-complexity decoding algorithm and can achieve symmetric channel capacity. However, the majority of research works have focused on the codes constructed by the binary kernel ($2 \times 2$ polarization matrix) which bounds the code length to an integer power of 2. Multi-kernel polar codes have been proposed as a method that allows the construction of polar codes with sizes different from powers of 2 by mixing multiple kernels of different dimensions. A hardware implementation based on the successive cancellation (SC) algorithm found in the literature shows that it suffers from a long decoding latency. In this paper, we design and implement a multi-kernel decoder based on the fast-simplified SC (fast-SSC) algorithm to decrease the decoding latency. It can decode any code constructed by binary and ternary ($3 \times 3$ ) kernels featuring flexible code length, code rate, and kernel sequence. FPGA implementation results reveal that a polar code of length $N = 1536$ , rate $\mathcal {R} = 1/2$ with Processing Element ($P_{e}$ ) value of $P_{e} = 240$ , gains 84.6% lower latency compared to the original algorithm. Also, the architecture supports polar codes constructed by purely-binary and purely-ternary kernels. A polar code of length $N = 1024$ , rate $\mathcal {R} = 1/2$ , and $P_{e} = 120$ achieves an information throughput of 432 Mbps."",,This work was supported by the Academy of Finland through 6G Flagship Program under Grant 346208.,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-11-14,2022-01-01,10,,119460-119474,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Rezaei, Hossein"; Rajatheva, Nandana;" Latva-Aho, Matti"",""Rezaei, Hossein (Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, 90570, Oulu, Finland)"; Rajatheva, Nandana (Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, 90570, Oulu, Finland);" Latva-Aho, Matti (Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, 90570, Oulu, Finland)"",""Rezaei, Hossein (University of Oulu)"",""Rezaei, Hossein (University of Oulu)"; Rajatheva, Nandana (University of Oulu);" Latva-Aho, Matti (University of Oulu)"",10,10,,5.21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9668973/09947089.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152727939,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, the mechanical properties of white Portland cement (WPC) paste mixed with basalt fiber (BF) were analyzed and its electromagnetic properties were fully investigated. First, the fluidity and strength of WPC pastes with different BF contents were tested. Subsequently, the electromagnetic parameters of WPC paste samples were tested in the frequency band of 3.94 GHz–5.99 GHz, and their electromagnetic transmission properties were calculated. Finally, the mechanism of BF affecting the strength and electromagnetic transmission performance of WPC pastes was profiled using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The results show that BF can reduce the fluidity of WPC pastes. With the increase of BF doping, the strength of WPC paste rises and then decreases, and reaches the maximum strength when the volume content of BF is 0.6%. With the increase of BF content, the electromagnetic wave reflection rate of WPC paste decreases, but the absorption and transmission rate increases. The bridging effect of BF, etc. improves the strength of the paste. In WPC pastes, with the increase of BF doping, the increase of electromagnetic wave absorption rate is smaller than the decrease of reflection rate, which leads to the improvement of electromagnetic transmission performance."",The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by National Natural Science Foundation of China (52078015)";" Beijing Natural Science Foundation (8202005).,,Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering,,,,2023-01-20,2023,2023-01-20,,23,1,63,Closed,Article,""Li, Yue"; Liu, Yunze; Cheng, Yaping;" Jin, Caiyun"",""Li, Yue (Key Laboratory of Urban Security and Disaster Engineering of Ministry of Education, Beijing Key Laboratory of Earthquake Engineering and Structural Retrofit, Beijing University of Technology, 100124, Beijing, China)"; Liu, Yunze (Key Laboratory of Urban Security and Disaster Engineering of Ministry of Education, Beijing Key Laboratory of Earthquake Engineering and Structural Retrofit, Beijing University of Technology, 100124, Beijing, China); Cheng, Yaping (Key Laboratory of Urban Security and Disaster Engineering of Ministry of Education, Beijing Key Laboratory of Earthquake Engineering and Structural Retrofit, Beijing University of Technology, 100124, Beijing, China);" Jin, Caiyun (Faculty of Science, Beijing University of Technology, 100124, Beijing, China)"",""Liu, Yunze (Beijing University of Technology)"",""Li, Yue (Beijing University of Technology)"; Liu, Yunze (Beijing University of Technology); Cheng, Yaping (Beijing University of Technology);" Jin, Caiyun (Beijing University of Technology)"",4,4,,2.78,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154712983,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"405,pub.1166980290,10.1109/ted.2023.3340663,,,Inherent Suppression of Transverse Modes on LiTaO3/AT-Quartz SAW Devices,""Featuring a pronounced leakage suppression of acoustic energy, the construction of multilayer stacks offers an effective avenue for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices to remain competitive in fifth-generation (5G) applications. While the target modes experience significant enhancement due to the waveguide effect, transverse spurious responses are also confined and amplified, leading to severe in-band ripples and limited rejection in the corresponding filter. Guided by the slowness dispersion analysis, commercially available AT-Quartz was identified as the optimal substrate that inherently suppresses these unwanted modes without additional countermeasures. The mechanism of slowness manipulation by combining several substrates including AT-Quartz, Si, SiC, and Sapphire with LiTaO3 was studied through the finite-element method (FEM), validating the superior potential of AT-Quartz for transverse mode suppression. Furthermore, the curvature dispersion characteristic of the slowness curve on the $42^{\circ }{Y}$ – ${X}$ LiTaO3 (LT)/AT-Quartz platform as functions of ${h}_{\text {LT}}/\lambda $ and ${h}_{\text {Al}}/\lambda $ were investigated, which revealed a substantial parameter space devoid of spurious responses. Under the guidance of the suppression window, a series of spurious-free resonators with pure spectrum were successfully implemented without any treatment of interdigital transducer (IDT), with a typical one maintaining a remarkable maximum Bode- ${Q}$ value of 2891 and a large figure of merit (FoM) of 334.

It offers very high-speed Internet connections for several geographical areas: urban, suburban, and rural. Many mobile network operators (MNOs) continuously monitor the quality of service in terms of multiple services to guarantee highnetworkperformance. To the best of our knowledge, no extensive studies and analyses are conducted on mobile broadband (MBB) services that cover various implementation scenarios and several performance metrics. This study comprehensively analyzes the existing MBB performance in an urban area: Cyberjaya City, Malaysia. The measurement data were collected through drive tests from various MNOs supporting 3G and 4G technologies: Maxis, Celcom, Digi, U Mobile, and Unifi. Several performance metrics, such as signal quality, throughput (downlink and uplink), ping, and handover, were measured during the drive tests. The data measurements were conducted in two scenarios: outdoor and indoor environments. Measurement results of the outdoor drive test demonstrate that the maximum average throughput with downlink and uplink data rates is 14.3 and 7.1 Mbps, respectively, whereas the minimum average ping and loss are 36.5 ms and 0.14, respectively, for all MNOs. However, the in-building measurements achieve an acceptable overall average data rate of 2 Mbps. This paper provides several suggestions and recommendations for MBB providers to improve their performance networks and quality of experience to meet customers’ satisfaction.

Today, performance problems are usually solved through cloud, fog and edge computing, while the problem of data storage and transmission security remains relevant. One of the effective ways to solve this problem is to use blockchain technology. Purpose: Designing the architecture of a fog computing network based on blockchain technology. Results: Based on the research in the field of fog computing, the requirements for the fog computing architecture were determined, such as: autonomy, scalability, flexibility, hierarchy, security, reliability, availability, serviceability. The selected criteria for building an architecture led to the choice in favor of a private blockchain due to its higher performance compared to a public blockchain  A comparative analysis of the consensus algorithms that are most often used in private blockchains was carried out and the most suitable one was chosen. Based on the requirements put forward and the results of the analysis, a fog computing architecture model based on a private blockchain was designed. The architecture consists of four elements: end devices, fog nodes, orchestration nodes, and cloud infrastructure. The blockchain includes fog nodes and orchestration nodes, which ensures the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in the fog network. Practical relevance:  Paper results can be used in the design of fog computing networks both separately and as part of 5G mobile networks."",,,Information and Control Systems,,,,2022-10-28,2022,2022-10-28,,,5,40-48,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Pimenov, Andrey"; Fedorov, Ivan;" Bezzateev, Sergey"",""Pimenov, Andrey ()"; Fedorov, Ivan ();" Bezzateev, Sergey ()"",,""Pimenov, Andrey ()"; Fedorov, Ivan ();" Bezzateev, Sergey ()"",2,2,,0.85,http://i-us.ru/index.php/ius/article/download/15348/15136,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152471040,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Numerous network analyses of real complex systems usually focus on static networks";" however, it is difficult to describe that most real networks undergo topological evolutions over time. Temporal networks, which incorporate time attributes into traditional static network models, can more accurately depict the temporal features of network evolution. Here, we introduced the time attribute of the life cycle of emerging technology into the evolution dynamics of its innovation network, constructed an emerging technology temporal innovation network from a temporal network perspective, and established its evolution model in combination with the life cycle and key attributes of emerging technology. Based on this model, we took 5G technology as an example to conduct network evolution simulation, verified the rationality of the above model building, and analyzed the cyclical evolution dynamics of this network in various topological structures. The results show that the life cycle of emerging technology, as well as multiple knowledge attributes based on the key attributes of emerging technology, are important factors that affect network evolution by acting on node behaviors. Within this study, we provide a more realistic framework to describe the internal mechanism of the cyclical evolution of emerging technology innovation network, which can extend the research on innovation network evolution from the single topological dynamics to the topological–temporal dynamics containing time attributes and enrich the research dimensions of innovation network evolution from the perspective of temporal evolution."",,""This research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China, grant number 22AZD137, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 72274147."",Systems,,,,2023-02-05,2023,2023-02-05,,11,2,82,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Liu, Yaqin"; Chen, Yunsi; He, Qing;" Yu, Qian"",""Liu, Yaqin (School of Economics, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430048, China)"; Chen, Yunsi (School of Economics, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan 430048, China); He, Qing (School of Economics, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China);" Yu, Qian (School of Economics, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China)"",""Yu, Qian (Wuhan University of Technology)"",""Liu, Yaqin (Wuhan Polytechnic University)"; Chen, Yunsi (Wuhan Polytechnic University); He, Qing (Wuhan University of Technology);" Yu, Qian (Wuhan University of Technology)"",3,3,,2.02,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/11/2/82/pdf?version=1677048079,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155172988,33 Built Environment and Design"; 3302 Building; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"398,pub.1148765252,10.1109/access.2022.3183989,,,Toward Integrating Intelligence and Programmability in Open Radio Access Networks: A Comprehensive Survey,""Open RAN is an emerging vision and an advancement of the Radio Access Network (RAN). Its purpose is to implement a vendor and network-generation agnostic RAN, provide networking solutions across all service requests, and implement artificial intelligence solutions in different stages of an end-to-end communication path. The 5th Generation (5G) and beyond the 5th Generation (B5G) of networking introduce and support new use cases, such as tactile internet and autonomous driving. The complexity and innovative nature of these use cases require continuous innovation at a high pace in the RAN. The traditional approach of building end-to-end RAN solutions by only one vendor hampers the speed of innovation—furthermore, the lack of a standard approach to implementing artificial intelligence complicates the compatibility of products with the RAN ecosystem. O-RAN Alliance, a community of industry and academic experts in RAN, works on writing Open RAN specifications on top of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards. Founded on these specifications, the aim of this paper is to introduce open research topics in Open RAN that overlap the interests of both AI and telecommunication researchers. The paper provides an overview of the architecture and components of Open RAN, then explores AI use cases in Open RAN. Also, this survey includes some plausible AI deployment scenarios that the specifications have not covered. Open RAN in future cities creates opportunities for various use cases across different sectors, including engineering, operations, and research that this paper addresses."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-06-17,2022-01-01,10,,67747-67770,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Arnaz, Azadeh"; Lipman, Justin; Abolhasan, Mehran;" Hiltunen, Matti"",""Arnaz, Azadeh (School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia)"; Lipman, Justin (School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia); Abolhasan, Mehran (School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, 2007, Australia);" Hiltunen, Matti (AT&T Labs Research, Bedminster, NJ, 07921, USA)"",""Arnaz, Azadeh (University of Technology Sydney)"",""Arnaz, Azadeh (University of Technology Sydney)"; Lipman, Justin (University of Technology Sydney); Abolhasan, Mehran (University of Technology Sydney);" Hiltunen, Matti (AT&T (United States))"",40,39,,20.78,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09798822.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148765252,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, it is still a challenging issue for ADV to retrieve real-time positioning knowledge over road participants and dynamic surrounding environments, due to unsatisfied perception accuracy caused by sparse observations and limited perception range. Cooperative perception, which advocates cooperatively disseminating perception data among vehicles, has the potential to overcome the above limitations. To this end, this article proposes a novel edge-assisted multi-vehicle perception system to enhance vehicles’ awareness over surrounding environments, which is termed as EdgeCooper. EdgeCooper first schedules vehicles to share complementarity-enhanced and redundancy-minimized raw sensor data with an edge server, using multi-hop cooperative 5G V2X communications. Then, EdgeCooper merges vehicles’ individual views to form a holistic view with a higher resolution, thus enhancing perception robustness and enlarging perception range. We formulate multi-vehicle multi-hop cooperative data sharing as a minimum cost flow problem with conflict, and further prove that there exists no polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a constant performance ratio unless P = NP. Furthermore, a two-dimension graph coloring algorithm with guaranteed performance is proposed to eliminate conflict. We evaluate EdgeCooper by building a comprehensive simulation platform through a joint manipulation of SUMO, CARLA, NS3, and PyTorch. The experiment results show that, compared to a single vehicle’s perception, EdgeCooper performs effective and efficient in enhancing vehicular awareness, e.g., extending up to 3.6 times detection range and improving perception accuracy by 20%."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2022YFB4300400, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62102041 and Grant 62272053, and in part by the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) under Grant 2022QNRC001."",IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,2023-10-09,2023,2023-10-09,2024-01-01,42,1,207-222,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Luo, Guiyang"; Shao, Chongzhang; Cheng, Nan; Zhou, Haibo; Zhang, Hui; Yuan, Quan;" Li, Jinglin"",""Luo, Guiyang (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China"; Key State Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, China); Shao, Chongzhang (School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, 100876, China); Cheng, Nan (Key State Laboratory of ISN and the School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, China); Zhou, Haibo (School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China); Zhang, Hui (School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China); Yuan, Quan (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China; Key State Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi’an, 710071, China);" Li, Jinglin (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"",""Cheng, Nan (Xidian University)"",""Luo, Guiyang (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"; Xidian University); Shao, Chongzhang (Beijing Jiaotong University); Cheng, Nan (Xidian University); Zhou, Haibo (Nanjing University); Zhang, Hui (Nanjing University); Yuan, Quan (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Xidian University);" Li, Jinglin (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",51,51,,37.07,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/49/5594698/10274112.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164804569,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Along these lines, the thermal conductivity distribution of the electronic packaging materials, which plays a key role in the protecting circuits, requires urgent improvement. In this study, amino-functional boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) were prepared by employing ball milling boron nitride with urea (aqueous solution) as agents. Then, the epoxy composites filled with large size pristine boron nitride (pBN) and small size functional boron nitride were fabricated by using the wet ball-milling (wBN) technique. The acquired results indicate that the thermal conductivity property of the pBN/wBN/epoxy composites with pBN/wBN ratio of 2.5/7.5 can reach the value of 0.386 W/mK, which is 96% higher than that of pure epoxy. Meanwhile, the measured value is superior from both the pBN/epoxy and wBN/epoxy composites with the same filling amount. This effect can be attributed to the efficient construction of the fillers network and thermal conduction path. Within the epoxy matrix, wBN can fill the pores between pBN and form a denser filler network. In addition, the amino-functional groups grafted with wBN result in their enhanced dispersion within the epoxy matrix that leads to a more stronger interfacial effect. Our approach provides useful insights in understanding the incorporation mechanisms of fillers in polymers, and thereby enhancing their potential applications."",""This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61774023), Scientific and Technological Development Project of Jilin Province, China (Grant No. 20190101008JH), Scientific and Technological Development Project of Jilin Province, China (Grant No. 20200403048SF)."",,Ceramics International,,,,2022-01,2022,,2022-01,48,2,2763-2770,Closed,Article,""Wang, Wei"; Zhao, Man; Jiang, Dayong; Zhou, Xuan;" He, Jiaqi"",""Wang, Wei (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, 130022, China)"; Zhao, Man (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, 130022, China); Jiang, Dayong (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, 130022, China; Engineering Research Center of Optoelectronic Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Changchun, 130022, PR China); Zhou, Xuan (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, 130022, China);" He, Jiaqi (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun, 130022, China)"",""Zhao, Man (Changchun University of Science and Technology)"; Jiang, Dayong (Changchun University of Science and Technology;" Engineering Research Center of Optoelectronic Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Changchun, 130022, PR China)"",""Wang, Wei (Changchun University of Science and Technology)"; Zhao, Man (Changchun University of Science and Technology); Jiang, Dayong (Changchun University of Science and Technology; Engineering Research Center of Optoelectronic Functional Materials, Ministry of Education, Changchun, 130022, PR China); Zhou, Xuan (Changchun University of Science and Technology);" He, Jiaqi (Changchun University of Science and Technology)"",24,16,,4.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141850435,40 Engineering"; 4016 Materials Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This kind of lightweight, scalable and green network architecture will be well-received. In a wide variety of IoT application scenarios, sensor nodes deployed in a local space, such as a multistory building, automatically form a distributed 3D wireless IoT and it can be employed to collect and analyze environmental information. Source-location privacy protection is of great importance in these networks and however, most existing schemes focus on only planar distributed networks which are not suitable for the 3D networks. In this paper, we consider a novel trace-back attack for 3D wireless IoT and then design a source-location privacy protection scheme, named DMR-3D, to defend this kind of novel attacks. In DMR-3D, the source node first selects a set of virtual locations to indirectly choose a set of agent nodes based on the cold start sphere structure and the ellipsoid communication pipeline. Then, a sophisticated mechanism is designed based on both the connected graph and Multiple Delaunay Triangulation (MDT) structure of the network to deliver packets from the source node to the destination node via these agent nodes in a relay manner. Analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can effectively protect source-location privacy with a moderate increment of path stretch, time delay and data transmission amount."",,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62001055 and Grant 62102017.,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,,,,2022-02-10,2022,2022-02-10,2022-08-01,30,4,1765-1779,Closed,Article,""Fu, Junsong"; Wang, Na; Nie, Leyao; Cui, Baojiang;" Bhargava, Bharat K."",""Fu, Junsong (School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"; Wang, Na (School of Cyber Science and Technology, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China); Nie, Leyao (School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Cui, Baojiang (School of Cyberspace Security, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China);" Bhargava, Bharat K.

In this article, we formulate an extended Kalman filtering (EKF)-based framework called MU-PoSAC (Multi-User Positioning, Synchronization and Anchor State Calibration), that allows to jointly estimate and track the locations and clock offsets of multiple users together with the unknown locations and orientation offsets of the anchors, building on angle-of-arrival (AoA) and time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements. We provide an extensive set of numerical results in the context of mmWave 5G New Radio (NR) deployment in an industrial facility with moving robots and other industrial vehicles, incorporating full-scale ray-tracing for accurate propagation modeling as well as actual uplink reference signal based AoA and ToA estimators. Our numerical results show that estimating and tracking the overall system state is feasible, and that a single reference anchor can further enhance the estimation accuracy. In addition, more users are shown to lead to better performance, due to the beneficial coupling of the anchor state. Therefore, our study demonstrates that in order to maximize the estimation performance, it is desirable to have at least one anchor state precisely known, and to have multiple users in the system. Finally, the important practical aspect of Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockage is addressed. It is shown that in the considered industrial use case, the proposed MU-PoSAC framework can offer robustness against intermittent LoS blockage."",,""This work was supported in part by the Academy of Finland, under Projects 328226, 328214, 323244, 338224, 345654, and 352754, and in part by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation through Projects 5G VIIMA and 6G ISAC."",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2023-03-29,2023,2023-03-29,,72,8,10949-10964,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Lu, Yi"; Kaltiokallio, Ossi; Koivisto, Mike; Talvitie, Jukka; Lohan, Elena Simona; Wymeersch, Henk;" Valkama, Mikko"",""Lu, Yi (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland)"; Kaltiokallio, Ossi (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland); Koivisto, Mike (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland); Talvitie, Jukka (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland); Lohan, Elena Simona (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland); Wymeersch, Henk (Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, 41296, Goteborg, Sweden);" Valkama, Mikko (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University, FI-33014, Tampere, Finland)"",""Valkama, Mikko (Tampere University)"",""Lu, Yi (Tampere University)"; Kaltiokallio, Ossi (Tampere University); Koivisto, Mike (Tampere University); Talvitie, Jukka (Tampere University); Lohan, Elena Simona (Tampere University); Wymeersch, Henk (Chalmers University of Technology);" Valkama, Mikko (Tampere University)"",7,7,,6.05,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/25/4356907/10086654.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156610258,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Their microwave dielectric properties, crystal structure, and microscopic appearance were investigated. The ceramics exhibited a cubic fluorite-like structure similar to that of Nd5Mo3O16, with a Pn-3n (222) space group. In addition, second-phase CaMoO4 was present. The sintering mechanism of these ceramics was investigated via DSC-TG, which revealed that the sintering process occurred in two steps. Firstly, the raw materials generated CaMoO4 and Ln2MoO6 (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm). As the sintering temperature increased, the two phases underwent a chemical reaction to form the CaLn4Mo3O16 (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) ceramics. The grains grew as the sintering temperature increased, and improvements in the microwave dielectric properties were also observed. An excessively high sintering temperature leads to overfiring and abnormal grain growth, resulting in degradation of the microwave dielectric properties. The microwave dielectric properties of the ceramics were closely related to their compositions, bulk densities, and grain sizes. The CaLn4Mo3O16 (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) ceramics exhibited excellent microwave dielectric properties with ε r , Q × ƒ, and τ ƒ of 13.6, 54182 GHz, and −26.0 ppm/°C for CaLa4Mo3O16 at 1375 °C, respectively";" 13.84, 44560 GHz, −42.8 ppm/°C for CaNd4Mo3O16 at 1400 °C, respectively, and 14.57, 61920 GHz, −40.2 ppm/°C for CaSm4Mo3O16 at 1400 °C, respectively.

Adopting BERT as the vector embedding layer to obtain the vector sequence of fault text, designing a fault entity recognition model for power communication equipment based on BERT-BiGRU-CRF, and completing the construction of the relationship set of fault text. The proposed knowledge graph-based power communication equipment fault intelligent diagnosis model combined with the WBLA-based power communication equipment fault severity level recognition algorithm to obtain different severity fault information, from which a TFIDF-COS-based power communication equipment fault intelligent diagnosis algorithm is designed to realize intelligent diagnosis of power communication equipment faults.

"389,pub.1160733108,10.3390/app13148144,,,""Globalized Knowledge-Based, Simulation-Driven Antenna Miniaturization Using Domain-Confined Surrogates and Dimensionality Reduction"",""The design of contemporary antenna systems encounters multifold challenges, one of which is a limited size. Compact antennas are indispensable for new fields of application such as the Internet of Things or 5G/6G mobile communication. Still, miniaturization generally undermines electrical and field performance. When attempted using numerical optimization, it turns into a constrained problem with costly constraints requiring electromagnetic (EM) simulations. At the same time, due to the parameter redundancy of compact antennas, size reduction poses a multimodal task. In particular, the achievable miniaturization rate heavily depends on the starting point, while identifying a suitable starting point is a challenge on its own. These issues indicate that miniaturization should be addressed using global optimization methods. Unfortunately, the most popular nature-inspired algorithms cannot be applied for solving size reduction tasks because of their inferior computational efficacy and difficulties in handling constraints. This work proposes a novel methodology for the globalized size reduction of antenna structures. Our methodology is a multi-stage knowledge-based procedure, initialized with the detection of the approximate location of the feasible region boundary, followed by the construction of a dimensionality-reduced metamodel and global optimization thereof";" the last stage is the miniaturization-oriented local refinement of geometry parameters. For cost reduction, the first stages of the procedure are realized with the use of a low-fidelity EM antenna model. Our approach is verified using four broadband microstrip antennas and benchmarked against multi-start local search as well as nature-inspired methods. Superior size reduction rates are demonstrated for all considered cases while maintaining reasonably low computational costs."",""The authors thank Dassault Systemes, France, for making CST Microwave Studio available."",""This work was supported in part by the Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS), Grant 239858, and by the National Science Centre of Poland, Grant 2020/37/B/ST7/01448."",Applied Sciences,,,,2023-07-13,2023,2023-07-13,,13,14,8144,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Koziel, Slawomir"; Pietrenko-Dabrowska, Anna;" Golunski, Lukasz"",""Koziel, Slawomir (Engineering Optimization & Modeling Center, Reykjavik University, 102 Reykjavik, Iceland";, koziel@ru.is; Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, 80-233 Gdansk, Poland;, lukasz.golunski@pg.edu.pl); Pietrenko-Dabrowska, Anna (Engineering Optimization & Modeling Center, Reykjavik University, 102 Reykjavik, Iceland;, koziel@ru.is; Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, 80-233 Gdansk, Poland;, lukasz.golunski@pg.edu.pl); Golunski, Lukasz (Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, 80-233 Gdansk, Poland;", lukasz.golunski@pg.edu.pl)"",""Pietrenko-Dabrowska, Anna (Reykjavík University";" Gdańsk University of Technology)"",""Koziel, Slawomir (Reykjavík University"; Gdańsk University of Technology); Pietrenko-Dabrowska, Anna (Reykjavík University; Gdańsk University of Technology);" Golunski, Lukasz (Gdańsk University of Technology)"",2,2,,1.52,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/14/8144/pdf?version=1689230111,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160733108,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The C2C interface further facilitates building phased array panels by allowing the use of grid-based PCB routing, thus providing flexibility in the system design. An eight-element RFIC capable of handling two independent data-streams is fabricated using 45-nm CMOS technology. The RFIC incorporates four C2C interfaces operating at 27 GHz, two C2C interfaces operating at 9 GHz, and a complex baseband (BB) with single-sided bandwidth in excess of 400 MHz. The architecture is tested by flip-chip bonding two fabricated RFICs on an eight-layer Megtron 7 PCB. In this article, only the receiver path of the RFIC and the phased array is described. Performance of both the single RFIC and the combination using the 27-GHz C2C interface is demonstrated using conductive and over-the-air (OTA) measurements. OTA measurements are conducted using 5GNR FR2 OFDM waveforms with a signal bandwidth of up to 800 MHz. The measured RF to BB conversion gain for a single element is larger than 23 dB and the minimum measured noise figure (NF) is 6.2 dB. The nominal dc power consumed by the receiver per element per stream is 116.5 mW. The RFIC occupies a normalized area per element per data stream of 2.7 mm2. The RFIC is capable of supporting dual-polarized antennas or in a large-scale panel utilizing the same antenna elements to two independently weighted data streams as part of the hybrid beamforming architecture."",The authors would like to thank GlobalFoundries for providing silicon fabrication through the 45RFSOI university program and Keysight for providing measurement equipment.,""This work was supported in part by Nokia, in part by the Academy of Finland, 6G Flagship program under Grant 346208, in part by the Business Finland Projects NGmining under Grant 44049/31/2020, and in part by RFSampo under Grant 3071/31/2021."",IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,,,,2023-05-22,2023,2023-05-22,2023-07-01,58,7,1987-2004,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Sethi, Alok"; Akbar, Rehman; Hietanen, Mikko; Aikio, Janne P.; Kursu, Olli; Jokinen, Markku; Leinonen, Marko E.; Rahkonen, Timo;" Pärssinen, Aarno"",""Sethi, Alok (Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, 90570, Oulu, Finland)"; Akbar, Rehman (Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, 90570, Oulu, Finland); Hietanen, Mikko (Faculty of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, 90570, Oulu, Finland); Aikio, Janne P.

"388,pub.1149467670,10.1016/j.comcom.2022.07.011,,,Investigating predictive model-based control to achieve reliable consistent multipath mmWave communication,""Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio is a key building block in 5G and beyond cellular networks. However, mmWave channels are very sensitive to environmental conditions and depend on Line-of-Sight connections to provide very high data rates. Achieving reliable, consistent communication – i.e., a steady link rate together with low delay – over mmWave links is therefore a challenging problem. The goal of this work is to explore the use of predictive control to manage and simultaneously use multiple available mmWave paths to achieve reliable consistent communication by means of a multipath proxy. We investigate transient solutions of Markov Modulated Fluid Queues (MMFQ) to model the short-term evolution of the proxy’s packet queue, consistent with the use of Markovian models to capture the behavior of mmWave channel blocking. We propose a combination of models that can be solved using newly proposed matrix-analytic techniques in a timely enough manner for use in real-time control. This gives us a prediction, over a short time horizon, of either proxy queue distributions or probabilities of reaching particular proxy buffer levels. Thus, it enables the proxy to make preemptive path decisions in order to maintain a desired Quality of Service. A proof-of-concept simulation study demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed MMFQ-based predictive approach over both static and purely reactive control approaches. Further, we explore the potential benefits of a hybrid approach to path management, combining both predictive and reactive control. This can allow the controller to cater for unforeseen events that cannot be forecast by the predictive controller, mitigating the resulting extra queuing and corresponding delay spikes."",""The authors would like to thank Gabor Horvath for providing early access to [18] and help in understanding their Matlab code, especially with respect to the transient first passage time calculations.

In order to meet the constantly growing demand for internet services, the blockchain radio access network (B-RAN), a decentralized radio access approach, has emerged. Yet, many issues of B-RAN modeling to be clarified and are hard to define. In this article, we present a novel Blockchain-empowered Radio Access Network (BeRAN) paradigm and in-depth fundamental mathematical modeling of the proposed framework by building a capacity and latency trade-off relationship using the queuing model. In addition, a novel resource aggregation and network sharing mechanism has been proposed, and we investigated BeRAN's performance on both permissioned and permissionless Blockchain in terms of end-to-end latency and network capacity based on the queuing model. Moreover, the blockchain communication overhead and network base station (BS) load are considered to understand BeRAN's performance better. In addition, comparing the proposed BeRAN with the existing RAN and Proof-of-Work (PoW) frameworks improved the average throughput by 36.04% and resource utilization percentage by 28.7%. On the other hand, this mechanism reduced the average latency by 66.14% and average access time by 58.8% compared to the existing RAN framework. It is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed BeRAN mechanism can be used for various security applications of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks with improved efficacy and privacy."",,Not applicable.,The Journal of Supercomputing,,,,2023-04-28,2023,2023-04-28,2023-10,79,15,16479-16528,Closed,Article,""Roopa, Vuppula";" Pradhan, Himansu Shekhar"",""Roopa, Vuppula (Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Telangana, India)";" Pradhan, Himansu Shekhar (Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Telangana, India)"",""Pradhan, Himansu Shekhar (National Institute of Technology Warangal)"",""Roopa, Vuppula (National Institute of Technology Warangal)";" Pradhan, Himansu Shekhar (National Institute of Technology Warangal)"",3,3,,2.32,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157611473,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For these applications, PC is required to combine satisfactory fire retardancy and great toughness while retain its mechanical strength and optical transparency. However, existing either fire retardants or toughening agents fail to enable PC to achieve such a required performance portfolio due to their improper molecular designs. To overcome this challenge, we, herein, rationally design a series of sulfonated ionomeric fire retardants (sSEBS-M, M = Na+, Zn2+, Ce3+) by sulfonating and neutralizing styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS). The sSEBS-M can be well-dispersed within the PC matrix with phase domain sizes less than 500 nm. Chemical structures of sSEBS-M and their dispersion within the polymer matrix strongly correlate to their comprehensive performances in PC. Among three sSEBS-M ionomers, sSEBS-Ce endows PC with better comprehensive performances. With 1.5 wt% of sSEBS-Ce, the final PC achieves a high limiting oxygen index of 33.5% and a desired UL-94 V-0 rating, in addition to a 53% reduction in peak heat release rate and a comparable transparency to virgin PC. Moreover, its impact toughness and ductility are enhanced by 40% and 116% with tensile strength well-preserved. The integrated performance portfolios are superior to previous counterparts. This work offers a novel strategy for the design of multifunctional ionomer-based fire retardants for creating high-performance PC and reveals its structure-composition-property relationship in PC, which will enable PC to realize its practical applications in above-mentioned industries."",""This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51991355, 52173083, 51873196), Australian Research Council Discovery Projects (Nos.

Therefore, continuous line-of-sight estimation and channel impairment compensation are crucial for user equipment to access a satellite and maintain connectivity. In this paper, we propose a framework based on actor-critic reinforcement learning for traffic scheduling in non-terrestrial networks scenario where the channel state is non-stationary due to the variability of the line of sight, which depends on the current satellite elevation. We deploy the framework as an agent in a multipath routing scheme where the user equipment can access more than one satellite simultaneously to improve link reliability and throughput. We investigate how the agent schedules traffic in multiple satellite links by adopting policies that are evaluated by an actor-critic reinforcement learning approach. The agent continuously trains its model based on variations in satellite elevation angles, handovers, and relative line-of-sight probabilities. We compare the agent’s retraining time with the satellite visibility intervals to investigate the effectiveness of the agent’s learning rate. We carry out performance analysis while considering the dense urban area of Paris, where high-rise buildings significantly affect the line of sight. The simulation results show how the learning agent selects the scheduling policy when it is connected to a pair of satellites. The results also show that the retraining time of the learning agent is up to 0.1times the satellite visibility time at given elevations, which guarantees efficient use of satellite visibility."",,This work has been funded by The HORIZON-CL4-2021-SPACE-01 project “5G+ evoluTion to mutioRbitAl multibaNd neTwORks” (TRANTOR) No. 101081983.,Remote Sensing,,,,2023-03-30,2023,2023-03-30,,15,7,1842,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Machumilane, Achilles"; Gotta, Alberto; Cassará, Pietro; Amato, Giuseppe;" Gennaro, Claudio"",""Machumilane, Achilles (Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy";, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.); Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy); Gotta, Alberto (Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.); CNIT—National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications, 43124 Parma, Italy); Cassará, Pietro (Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.); CNIT—National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications, 43124 Parma, Italy); Amato, Giuseppe (Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.)); Gennaro, Claudio (Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);", claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.))"",""Machumilane, Achilles (Institute of Information Science and Technologies"; Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.);" University of Pisa)"",""Machumilane, Achilles (Institute of Information Science and Technologies"; Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.); University of Pisa); Gotta, Alberto (Institute of Information Science and Technologies; Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.); Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni); Cassará, Pietro (Institute of Information Science and Technologies; Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.); Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni); Amato, Giuseppe (Institute of Information Science and Technologies; Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);, claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.)); Gennaro, Claudio (Institute of Information Science and Technologies; Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), CNR, 56124 Pisa, Italy;, alberto.gotta@isti.cnr.it, (A.G.);, pietro.cassara@isti.cnr.it, (P.C.);, giuseppe.amato@isti.cnr.it, (G.A.);", claudio.gennaro@isti.cnr.it, (C.G.))"",4,4,,2.3,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/7/1842/pdf?version=1680163195,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156685679,40 Engineering"; 4013 Geomatic Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These ecosystems are related to different technologies and initiatives, such as 5G/6G, AI, cybersecurity, and data science. The interaction with these disciplines requires addressing complex challenges related with the implementation of flexible solutions that mix heterogeneous software and hardware, while providing high levels of customisability and manageability, creating the need for a blueprint reference architecture (RA) independent of particular existing vertical markets (e.g., energy, automotive, or smart cities). Different initiatives have partially dealt with the requirements of the architecture. However, the first complete, consolidated NGIoT RA, covering the hardware and software building blocks, and needed for the advent of NGIoT, has been designed in the ASSIST-IoT project. The ASSIST-IoT RA delivers a layered and modular design that divides the edge-cloud continuum into independent functions and cross-cutting capabilities. This contribution discusses practical aspects of implementation of the proposed architecture within the context of real-world applications. In particular, it is shown how use of cloud-native concepts (microservices and applications, containerisation, and orchestration) applied to the edge-cloud continuum IoT systems results in bringing the ASSIST-IoT concepts to reality. The description of how the design elements can be implemented in practice is presented in the context of an ecosystem, where independent software packages are deployed and run at the selected points in the hardware environment.

Towards standardizing and specifying the building blocks and principles of O-RAN, a coordinated global effort has been observed, mainly comprised of the O-RAN Alliance, the operators and several research activities. This paper presents the architectural aspects and the current status of O-RAN deployments, integrating both existing and ongoing activities from the O-RAN enablers. Furthermore, since the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) act as key pillars for realizing O-RANs, a comprehensive view on the AI/ML functionality is provided as well. Additionally, a Network Telemetry (NT) architecture is also proposed to ensure end-to-end data collection and real-time analytics. To concretely illustrate the O-RAN supporting mechanisms for hosting AI/ML, we implemented two realistic ML algorithms: (i) a Supervised Learning (SL) based algorithm for cell traffic prediction using the training data of an open dataset and (ii) a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based algorithm for energy-efficiency maximization using a 5G-compliant simulator to obtain RAN measurements. We schematically demonstrate the AI/ML workflow for both ML-assisted algorithms through the usage of xApps running on the Radio Intelligent Controller (RIC), as well as we outline the role of the O-RAN components involved in the AI/ML loop. Combining the high-level architectural descriptions with a detailed presentation of ML-empowered resource allocation schemes, the paper discusses and summarizes the O-RAN disaggregation principles and the role of AI/ML embedded in future O-RAN deployments."",The authors would like to thank the Affordable5G’s partnership for their valuable contribution in the technical aspects of this article.

Meanwhile, mobile network is moving towards data-driven paradigm, the issue of data privacy and data security seem to be a bottleneck. As a result, federated learning (FL) and mobile network are deeply converging. However, the mobile network is time-varying and the parameters of FL-empowered mobile network is huge and continue to increase with exponential growth of wireless terminals, result in the failure of traditional modeling. In the mobile networks, DT is conducive to prototyping, testing, and optimization, enabling mobile networks to be modelled more efficiently in a virtual environment and thus providing guidance for practical application. To this end, a communication-assisted sensing scenario is considered in this paper with FL in DT-empowered mobile networks. More specifically, two communication-assisted sensing architectures are proposed to improve communication efficiency of mobile network, namely, centralized architecture of federated transfer learning (FTL) and decentralized architecture of FTL. For centralized architecture of FTL, feature extraction of sensing information is conducted by FL between partial nodes and central server while the remaining nodes are used to train the fully connected layers at the central server. Considering data safety during the communication between sensing nodes, a decentralized architecture is designed based on FTL and Blockchain, where the feature extraction module is obtained by the fusion of sharing model (by Blockchain) and local model. The performance of proposed schemes is evaluated and demonstrated by the simulations."",,,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,2023-08-30,2023,2023-08-30,2023-10-01,41,10,3230-3241,Closed,Article,""Mu, Junsheng"; Ouyang, Wenjiang; Hong, Tao; Yuan, Weijie; Cui, Yuanhao;" Jing, Zexuan"",""Mu, Junsheng (School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Communications (BUPT), Beijing, 100876, China)"; Ouyang, Wenjiang (School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Communications (BUPT), Beijing, 100876, China); Hong, Tao (School of Electronic Information Engineering, Beihang University (BUAA), Beijing, 100876, China); Yuan, Weijie (School of Electronic, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, China); Cui, Yuanhao (School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Communications (BUPT), Beijing, 100876, China);" Jing, Zexuan (School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Communications (BUPT), Beijing, 100876, China)"",""Cui, Yuanhao (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Mu, Junsheng (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"; Ouyang, Wenjiang (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Hong, Tao (Beihang University); Yuan, Weijie (Southern University of Science and Technology); Cui, Yuanhao (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);" Jing, Zexuan (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",8,8,,6.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163689107,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"386,pub.1153570472,10.25130/tjes.29.4.2,,,Performance Analysis of Different Flexible Decoding Algorithms for NR-LDPC Codes,""Channel coding technique is a fundamental building block in any modern communication system to realize reliable, fast, and secure data transmission. At the same time, it is a challenging and crucial task, as the data transmission happens in a channel where noise, fading, and other impairments are present. The Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes give substantial results close to the Shannon limit when the complexity and processing delay time are unlimited. In this paper, the performance of the LDPC decoding with four algorithms was investigated. The investigated four algorithms were Belief Propagation (BP), Layered Belief Propagation (LBP), Normalized min-sum (NMS), and Offset min-sum (OMS). These algorithms were examined for code rates ranging from 1/3 to 9/10 and message block lengths (64, 512, 1024, and 5120) bits. The simulation results revealed the flexibility of these decoders in supporting these code rates and block lengths, which enables their usage in a wide range of applications and scenarios for fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication. In addition, the effect of the maximum number of decoding iterations on the error correction performance was investigated, and a gain of 5.6 dB can be obtained by using 32 decoding iterations at BER=2*10-3 instead of one decoding iteration. The results showed that the decoders performed better for longer message blocks than for short message blocks, and less power was required for transmitting longer messages. Finally, the comparison results of their performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) under the same conditions showed a gain of 0.8 dB using LBP at BER= 10-5 compared with the NMS decoding algorithm."",,,Tikrit Journal of Engineering Sciences,,,,2022-12-11,2022,2022-12-11,,29,4,10-18,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Salih, Layla M."; Al-Qaradaghi, Thuraya Mahmoud Ali;" Ameen, Jalal Jamal Hamad"",""Salih, Layla M.

However, this application scenario requires a very challenging combination of characteristics of gas sensors including small formfactor, low-cost, ultra-low power consumption, superior sensitivity, and high intelligence. Herein, we demonstrate self-powered integrated nanostructured-gas-sensor (SINGOR) systems and a wirelessly connected SINGOR network for the first time. The SINGOR features ultra-high sensitivity to H2, formaldehyde, toluene, and acetone with the record low limits of detection (LOD) of 10 ppb, 2 ppb, 1 ppb and 1 ppb, respectively, obtained under room temperature sensor operation. Therefore, ultra-low power consumption of 68.6 μW at sensor level and 1.71 mW at the system level has been achieved. As the result, an individual SINGOR system can be self-driven by indoor light with a Si solar cell. Furthermore, each SINGOR consists of an array of nanostructured sensors powered by machine learning algorithm and thus a SINGOR has the capability of gas pattern recognition and classification. And multiple SINGOR systems are wirelessly connected together to form a sensor network for smart home application demonstrations. Intriguingly, the sensor network has successfully demonstrated flammable gas leakage detection and alarm function when they are deployed in multiple rooms. And when the SINGOR network is deployed in one single room, it can achieve gas leakage localization with satisfactory precision. These successes open up the possibility of using nanostructured-gas-sensor network for wide range applications including smart home, smart building and future smart city."",,,ECS Meeting Abstracts,,,,2022-10-09,2022,,2022-10-09,MA2022-02,36,1322-1322,All OA";" Green,Article,""Song, Zhilong";" Fan, Zhiyong"",""Song, Zhilong (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)";" Fan, Zhiyong (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)"",,""Song, Zhilong (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)";" Fan, Zhiyong (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)"",0,0,,0.0,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Wireless_Self-Powered_High-Performance_Integrated_Nanostructured-Gas-Sensor_Network_for_Future_Smart_Homes/14449924/1/files/27642307.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152992149,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"384,pub.1158010365,10.3390/app13105902,,,Automatic Clustering for Improved Radio Environment Maps in Distributed Applications,""Wireless communication greatly contributes to the evolution of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. The new generation networks, including 5G and 6G, provide several connectivity advantages for multiple applications, such as smart health systems and smart cities. Adopting wireless communication technologies in these applications is still challenging due to factors such as mobility and heterogeneity. Predicting accurate radio environment maps (REMs) is essential to facilitate connectivity and improve resource utilization. The construction of accurate REMs through the prediction of reference signal received power (RSRP) can be useful in densely distributed applications, such as smart cities. However, predicting an accurate RSRP in the applications can be complex due to intervention and mobility aspects. Given the fact that the propagation environments can be different in a specific area of interest, the estimation of a common path loss exponent for the entire area produces errors in the constructed REM. Hence, it is necessary to use automatic clustering to distinguish between different environments by grouping locations that exhibit similar propagation characteristics. This leads to better prediction of the propagation characteristics of other locations within the same cluster. Therefore, in this work, we propose using the Kriging technique, in conjunction with the automatic clustering approach, in order to improve the accuracy of RSRP prediction. In fact, we adopt K-means clustering (KMC) to enhance the path loss exponent estimation. We use a dataset to test the proposed model using a set of comparative studies. The results showed that the proposed approach provides significant RSRP prediction capabilities for constructing REM, with a gain of about 3.3 dB in terms of root mean square error compared to the case without clustering."",The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jouf University for funding this work through research grant No. (39/826).,This work was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Jouf University under grant No. (39/826).,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-05-10,2023,2023-05-10,,13,10,5902,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Chikha, Haithem Ben";" Alaerjan, Alaa"",""Chikha, Haithem Ben (Department of Computer Engineering and Networks, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka 72341, Saudi Arabia)";" Alaerjan, Alaa (Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka 72341, Saudi Arabia)"",""Chikha, Haithem Ben (Al Jouf University)";" Alaerjan, Alaa (Al Jouf University)"",""Chikha, Haithem Ben (Al Jouf University)";" Alaerjan, Alaa (Al Jouf University)"",3,3,,2.35,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/10/5902/pdf?version=1683793017,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158010365,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The accessibility of high bandwidth Internet connection particularly with the arrival of robust 5G networks rises to innovative IoT solutions such as smart city, automobiles, industry 4.0, etc. IoT analytics represents edge computing as a term commonly employed for defining intelligent computational resources placed closer to the source of data generation. Despite the benefits of the IoT edge systems, security and energy efficiency remains major challenging issues. With this motivation, this paper presents an energy-efficient clustering based secure data transmission protocol (EEC-SDTP) for Intelligent IoT Edge systems. The goal of the EEC-SDTP technique is to select an appropriate set of cluster heads (CHs) and optimally secure routes for data transmission in the network. The proposed model involves oppositional chaos game optimization-based clustering (OCGOC) technique for proper CH selection and cluster construction. Besides, a trust-based model is designed to determine the trustworthiness of the node in the IoT edge systems. The proposed OCGOC technique derives a fitness function utilizing 3 input parameters like trust level, distance to neighbors, and energy. Finally, a trust-based secure routing protocol using the quantum sand piper optimization (SRP-QSPO) technique is employed to derive routes for secure data transmission. For examining the better efficiency of the proposed EEC-SDTP algorithm, an extensive group of experimentations were performed and the outcomes are investigated under several performance measures. The experimental outcomes highlighted the improved efficiency of the proposed method over the other related techniques."",""This work is partially funded by FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU funds under the Project UIDB/50008/2020";" and by Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq, via Grant No. 313036/2020-9."",,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,164,,142-151,Closed,Article,""Padmaa, M."; Jayasankar, T.; Venkatraman, S.; Dutta, Ashit Kumar; Gupta, Deepak; Shamshirband, Shahab;" Rodrigues, Joel J.P.C."",""Padmaa, M.

In this study, we deploy the radio frequency (RF) power station to provide energy to the UAV, accompanied by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) to assist a UAV user in offloading its tasks. In particular, this system consists of a power station, a UAV, and two access points, each of which has an MEC server and a STAR RIS installed within the building. The power station can transfer wireless power to the UAV via RF waves. A UAV user can apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes to offload its tasks to access points via STAR-RIS. In order to evaluate and optimize the performance, we derive the approximately closed-form expression for successful computation and energy outage probabilities by using the statistical characteristics of channel gains. Moreover, we introduced problem-solving based on a real-coded genetic algorithm (PRGA) to determine the optimal resource parameters and attain the highest system performance. Based on these criteria, we investigate the behaviors of a proposed system according to the system’s critical parameters, such as time switching ratio, transmit power, power allocation coefficient, data dividing ratio, number of elements of STAR-RIS, and altitude of the UAV. We also provide computer simulation results to validate our analysis. Finally, the research results have revealed that STAR-RIS can improve the performance of MEC networks by creating a smart communication environment."",This research is funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number 102.04-2021.11.,,Mobile Networks and Applications,,,,2023-12-01,2023,2024-05-21,2023-12-01,28,6,2245-2257,Closed,Article,""Ha, Dac-Binh"; Truong, Van-Truong; Truong, Tien-Vu;" Phan, Thanh-Minh"",""Ha, Dac-Binh (Faculty of Electrical-Electronic Engineering, Duy Tan University, 550000, Da Nang, Vietnam"; Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 550000, Da Nang, Vietnam); Truong, Van-Truong (Faculty of Electrical-Electronic Engineering, Duy Tan University, 550000, Da Nang, Vietnam; Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 550000, Da Nang, Vietnam); Truong, Tien-Vu (Faculty of Information Technology, Duy Tan University, 550000, Da Nang, Vietnam; Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, 550000, Da Nang, Vietnam);" Phan, Thanh-Minh (Vietnam Aviation Academy, 700000, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)"",""Truong, Van-Truong (Duy Tan University";" Duy Tan University)"",""Ha, Dac-Binh (Duy Tan University"; Duy Tan University); Truong, Van-Truong (Duy Tan University; Duy Tan University); Truong, Tien-Vu (Duy Tan University; Duy Tan University);" Phan, Thanh-Minh (Vietnam Aviation Academy)"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171865230,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It also enables mobile network operators to ensure their customer’s a better quality of service (QoS). Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a significant part of the mobile network due to their continuously growing use in various applications. For better coverage, cost-effective, and seamless service connectivity and provisioning, UAVs have emerged as the best choice for telco operators. UAVs can be used as flying base stations, edge servers, and relay nodes in mobile networks. On the other side, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) technology also emerged in the 5G network to provide a better quality of experience (QoE) to users with different QoS requirements. However, UAVs in a mobile network for coverage enhancement and better QoS face several challenges such as trajectory designing, path planning, optimization, QoS assurance, mobility management, etc. The efficient and proactive path planning and optimization in a highly dynamic environment containing buildings and obstacles are challenging. So, an automated Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled QoS-aware solution is needed for trajectory planning and optimization. Therefore, this work introduces a well-designed AI and MEC-enabled architecture for a UAVs-assisted future network. It has an efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm for real-time and proactive trajectory planning and optimization. It also fulfills QoS-aware service provisioning. A greedy-policy approach is used to maximize the long-term reward for serving more users with QoS. Simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed DRL mechanism for energy-efficient and QoS-aware trajectory planning over the existing models."",,,Computers Materials & Continua,,,,2023,2023,,2023,74,3,4685-4702,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Khan, Adil"; Zhang, Jinling; Ahmad, Shabeer; Memon, Saifullah; Hayat, Babar;" Rafiq, Ahsan"",""Khan, Adil (School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"; Zhang, Jinling (School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Ahmad, Shabeer (School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Memon, Saifullah (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Hayat, Babar (School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China);" Rafiq, Ahsan (Department of Automation, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China)"",""Khan, Adil (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Khan, Adil (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"; Zhang, Jinling (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Ahmad, Shabeer (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Memon, Saifullah (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Hayat, Babar (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);" Rafiq, Ahsan (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",7,7,,5.18,https://file.techscience.com/files/cmc/2023/TSP_CMC-74-3/TSP_CMC_34892/TSP_CMC_34892.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154075290,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is necessary to reexamine the internal relationship mechanism between local government digital action and regional governance behavior. Based on the theory of collective action and network governance, this paper discusses how the economic development level of local government interacts with the cooperative network status of urban agglomeration and affects the tendency of digital governance strategy of local government. By constructing the configuration matrix of “economic development level” and “cooperative network status” of local governments in urban agglomerations, this paper extracts the possible “center” and “follow” governance strategies that local governments in different configurations may adopt in the digital field. The ant colony optimization algorithm proposed in this paper consists of two parts—ACO initialization and ACO optimization. ACO initialization describes how to map the path of ants to the solution of the problem, that is, the combination of orders. In addition, ACO initialization will also define and initialize the pheromone and heuristic information model compatible with the solution. ACO optimization updates the pheromone model to heuristic guide ants to build paths, so as to iteratively find the optimal solution. The case study of 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta of China shows that most of the digital governance strategies of local governments are in line with the selection logic of their configuration status of “economic level network status”. The study results proved that the proposed model has provided effective accuracy of 96%. However, driven by selective returns, there are still some “abnormal” governance tendencies."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

However, if not implemented properly, mass customisation can lead to disturbances in material flow and severe reduction in productivity. Moreover, manufacturing enterprises often face the challenge of manufacturing highly customized products in small lot sizes. One solution to adapt to the ever-changing demands, which increases resource flexibility, lies in the digitization of the manufacturing systems. Furthermore, the distributed manufacturing environment and the ever-increasing product variety and complexity result in reduced time-to market, ubiquitous data access and sharing and adaptability and responsiveness to changes. These requirements can be achieved through smart manufacturing tools and especially Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Thus, the aim of this position paper is to summarize the design and development of solutions based on cutting-edge technologies such as Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Simulation, 5G, and so on. Concretely, the first part discusses the development of a Cloud-based production planning and control system for discrete manufacturing environments. The proposed approach takes into consideration capacity constraints, lot sizing and priority control in a “bucket-less” manufacturing environment. Then, an open and interoperable Internet of Things platform is discussed, which is enhanced by innovative tools and methods that transform them into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), supporting smart customized shopping, through gathering customers’ requirements, adaptive production, and logistics of vending machines replenishment and Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks for Smart Manufacturing. To that end, all the proposed methodologies are validated using data derived from Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine building industry, from European Metal-cutting and mold-making SMEs, from white goods industry and SMEs that produces solar panels."",,,Frontiers in Manufacturing Technology,,,,2022-07-19,2022,2022-07-19,,2,,937889,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Mourtzis, Dimitris"",""Mourtzis, Dimitris (Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems and Automation, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, University of Patras, Rio Patras, Greece)"",""Mourtzis, Dimitris (University of Patras)"",""Mourtzis, Dimitris (University of Patras)"",7,6,,2.75,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmtec.2022.937889/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149585774,40 Engineering"; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science;" 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"382,pub.1146315922,10.1016/j.phycom.2022.101685,,,Injection attack detection using machine learning for smart IoT applications,""Smart cities are a rapidly growing IoT application. These smart cities mainly rely on wireless sensors to connect their different components (smart devices) together. Smart cities rely on the integration of IoT and 5G technologies, and this has created a demand for a massive IoT network of connected devices. The data traffic coming from indoor wireless networks (e.g., smart homes, smart hospitals, smart factories , or smart school buildings) contributes to over 80% of the total data traffic of the current IoT network. As smart cities and their applications grow, security and privacy challenges have become a major concern for billions of IoT smart devices. One reason for this could be the oversight of handling security issues of IoT devices by their manufacturers, which enables attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities in these devices by performing different types of attacks, e.g., DDoS and injection attacks. Intrusion detection is one way to detect and mitigate the risk of such attacks. In this paper, an intrusion detection method was proposed to detect injection attacks in IoT applications (e.g. smart cities). In this method, two types of feature selection techniques (constant removal and recursive feature elimination) were used and tested by a number of machine learning classifiers (i.e., SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). The T-Test was conducted to evaluate the quality of this proposed feature selection method. Using the public dataset, AWID, the evaluation results showed that the decision tree classifier can be used to detect injection attacks with an accuracy of 99% using only 8 features, which were selected using the proposed feature selection method. Also, the comparison with the most related work showed the advantages of the proposed intrusion detection method."",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Physical Communication,,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,52,,101685,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Gaber, Tarek"; El-Ghamry, Amir;" Hassanien, Aboul Ella"",""Gaber, Tarek (School of Science, Engineering, and Environment, University of Salford, UK"; Faculty of Computers and Informatics, Suez Canal University, Ismailia 41522, Egypt; Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE), Egypt); El-Ghamry, Amir (Faculty of Computers and Information, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt; Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE), Egypt); Hassanien, Aboul Ella (Faculty of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University, Cairo, Postcode 12631, Egypt;" Scientific Research Group in Egypt (SRGE), Egypt)"",""Gaber, Tarek (University of Salford"; Suez Canal University;" Scientific Research Group in Egypt)"",""Gaber, Tarek (University of Salford"; Suez Canal University; Scientific Research Group in Egypt); El-Ghamry, Amir (Mansoura University; Scientific Research Group in Egypt); Hassanien, Aboul Ella (Cairo University;" Scientific Research Group in Egypt)"",72,67,,37.41,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phycom.2022.101685,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146315922,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since most applications require vehicles to report perceived information to nearby base stations, how to defend against malicious attacks and selfish behaviors of vehicles in reporting activities has become an essential security issue. Some researchers have attempted to encourage vehicles to actively report information by establishing reputations for them, but these efforts have some shortcomings. In model design, they neither verify the basis and process of reputation evaluation nor pay attention to the diversity and intelligence of vehicle behaviors. In system construction, they fail to meet the management needs of multi-party participation and provide verifiable reputation management services. In this paper, we propose $\mathcal{R}$-tracing, a consortium blockchain-based vehicle reputation management scheme. The main contribution of our work lies in three points. First, a vehicle reputation model is designed with a reward and punishment mechanism and a regular tax mechanism. Second, a vehicle reputation management system is constructed by multiple organizations, in which all tasks of reputation update are abstracted into three types of transactions. Finally, the effectiveness of $\mathcal{R}$-tracing is verified by extensive simulations running on a large-scale traffic scenario and performance evaluation on a prototype system. Compared with the typical linear reputation model, our model not only resists the usual malicious attack and selfish behavior but also effectively deals with the on-off attack and rational selfish behavior. In the throughput test, $\mathcal{R}$-tracing achieves 600tps, outperforming two state-of-the-art schemes."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1005500, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702288, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Southeast university."",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2023-01-20,2023,2023-01-20,,72,6,7095-7110,Closed,Article,""Xu, Yuwei"; Yu, Enze; Song, Yuxing; Tong, Fei; Xiang, Qiao;" He, Liang"",""Xu, Yuwei (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China"; Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, 211111, China; Engineering Research Center of Blockchain Application Supervision, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, 211189, China); Yu, Enze (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China); Song, Yuxing (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China); Tong, Fei (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China; Purple Mountain Laboratories, Nanjing, 211111, China; Engineering Research Center of Blockchain Application Supervision, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, 211189, China); Xiang, Qiao (School of informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361000, China);" He, Liang (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Colorado, Denver, 80204, USA)"",""Xu, Yuwei (Southeast University"; Purple Mountain Laboratories;" Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China)"",""Xu, Yuwei (Southeast University"; Purple Mountain Laboratories; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Yu, Enze (Southeast University); Song, Yuxing (Southeast University); Tong, Fei (Southeast University; Purple Mountain Laboratories; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Xiang, Qiao (Xiamen University);" He, Liang (University of Colorado Denver)"",11,11,,8.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154718919,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A new round of information technology revolution, represented by the Internet, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and fifth-generation mobile communications (5G), is driving profound changes in the automotive industry. Smart vehicles (also known as intelligent connected vehicles) that integrate many high-tech technologies to provide safer, more convenient, and low-carbon comprehensive travel solutions have become an inevitable form of future vehicles. This paper constructs a three-level supply chain consisting of high-performance chip suppliers, smart car manufacturers, and retailers. On the basis of considering the level of product innovation and sales effort, Stackelberg game method is used to study the influence of each player in the supply chain on each parameter and the profit of each player under three scenarios: centralized decision making, nonsharing of innovation cost, and sharing of innovation cost. The results show that: when the level of sales effort has nothing to do with the level of innovation, the level of product innovation and the total profit of the supply chain increase with the improvement of the retailer’s sales ability";" when the level of sales effort is related to the level of innovation, the level of product innovation under the cost-sharing decision model is greater than the case of no cost sharing, but the total profit of the supply chain is less than the case of no cost sharing."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.

While AI and DM offer significant benefits, they also carry the risk of unfavourable outcomes for users and society. As a result, ensuring the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of these systems becomes crucial. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the synergy between AI and DM, focussing on the importance of trustworthiness. The review addresses the following four key questions, guiding readers towards a deeper understanding of this topic: (i) why do we need trustworthy AI? (ii) what are the requirements for trustworthy AI? In line with this second question, the key requirements that establish the trustworthiness of these systems have been explained, including explainability, accountability, robustness, fairness, acceptance of AI, privacy, accuracy, reproducibility, and human agency, and oversight. (iii) how can we have trustworthy data? and (iv) what are the priorities in terms of trustworthy requirements for challenging applications? Regarding this last question, six different applications have been discussed, including trustworthy AI in education, environmental science, 5G‐based IoT networks, robotics for architecture, engineering and construction, financial technology, and healthcare. The review emphasises the need to address trustworthiness in AI systems before their deployment in order to achieve the AI goal for good. An example is provided that demonstrates how trustworthy AI can be employed to eliminate bias in human resources management systems. The insights and recommendations presented in this paper will serve as a valuable guide for AI researchers seeking to achieve trustworthiness in their applications."",""Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

However, civil GPS services are unencrypted and vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can manipulate UAVs’ location and abort the UAVs’ mission. This paper leverage 3D radio map and machine learning methods to detect and mitigate GPS spoofing attacks for cellular-connected UAVs. Precisely, the edge UAV flight controller uses ray tracing tools deterministic channel models, and Kriging methods to construct a theoretical 3D radio map. Then the machine learning methods, such as text Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), are employed to detect GPS spoofing by analyzing the UAV/base station reported Received Signal Strength (RSS) values and the theoretical radio map RSS values. Once spoofing is detected, the particle filter is applied to relocate the UAV and mitigate GPS deviation. The experiment results indicate that the Universal Kriging (UK) with exponential covariance function has the lowest standard errors for radio map construction. Moreover, the MLP achieves the highest spoofing detection accuracy with different spoofing margins because of the statistic prepossessing relieving environmental impacts, while the CNN has a comparable detection accuracy with less training time than MLP since CNN inputs are raw RSS data. Furthermore, the particle text filter-based GPS spoofing mitigation can relocate the UAV to the real position within an error of 10 meters using 100 particles."",,""This work was supported in part by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program through the 5G!Drones Project under Grant 857031, in part by the Academy of Finland through the ULTRA Project under Grant 328215, and in part by the Academy of Finland through the Backscatter Enabled Sustainable Monitoring Infrastructure for Assisted Living (BESIMAL) Project under Grant 334197."",IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking,,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-09-18,2023-01-01,1,,313-327,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Dang, Yongchao"; Karakoc, Alp; Norshahida, Saba;" Jäntti, Riku"",""Dang, Yongchao (Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Aalto University, 00076, Espoo, Finland)"; Karakoc, Alp (Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Aalto University, 00076, Espoo, Finland); Norshahida, Saba (Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Aalto University, 00076, Espoo, Finland);" Jäntti, Riku (Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Aalto University, 00076, Espoo, Finland)"",""Dang, Yongchao (Aalto University)"",""Dang, Yongchao (Aalto University)"; Karakoc, Alp (Aalto University); Norshahida, Saba (Aalto University);" Jäntti, Riku (Aalto University)"",11,11,,8.26,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/9882533/10070384/10254521.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164189244,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4611 Machine Learning,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The effective recovery of the electric charge relates to the smooth development of daily work and continuous improvement of the operation and management of power supply enterprises. With the large-scale implementation of the card prepayment system, the problem of electricity customers defaulting on electricity charges has been solved to a large extent, but some large electricity users still fail to pay electricity charges on time. Therefore, under the current situation of power grid development, it is still necessary to strengthen the service and management of electricity charges to promote efficient recovery of electricity charges. Speech recognition technology has increasingly become the focus of research institutions at home and abroad. People are committed to enabling machines to understand human speech instructions and hope to control the machine through speech. The research and development of speech recognition will greatly facilitate people's lives shortly. The development of 5G technology and the proposal of 6G technology make the interconnection of all things not only a hope but also a reality. To realize the interconnection of all things, one of the key technical breakthroughs is the development of a new human–computer interaction sensing system. Under the guidance of relevant theories and methods, this paper systematically analyzes the user structure, electricity charge recovery management and service system, existing problems and causes in South China, and clarifies the necessity of design and application of electricity charge service system in South China power supply companies.

An undoubted problem in implying such solutions is the security of transmission in such systems. It should be noted that security at a certain level of transmission is currently already offered by the radio transmission systems themselves, which has also been used in the GSM-R standard. The creation of a separate dedicated system for railroads involves huge expenditures for the design, testing, certification and, finally, construction and implementation of such technology. Therefore, in the opinion of the author of this dissertation, it is possible to use public open radio networks for the needs of railroads, which significantly reduces costs, since such a system is based on existing infrastructure. It is necessary to develop a way of transmitting information that meets the requirements of secure transmission in the sense of railroad traffic control systems. The task is to develop a general model for open radio transmission in traffic control systems based on the latest public radio standard, which is LTE, 5G or Future Railway Mobile Communications System (FRMCS). The article will present the concept of data transmission in the track vehicle relationship with the use of LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology.

Game theory and mathematical derivation are used to prove that the system overhead has an upper limit of convergence and to quantify several efficiency factors for centralized optimization performance. The system makes full use of part of the existing mobile network resources, combines traditional network optimization technology with advanced information mining and analysis tools, has complete information management capabilities, and guarantees the service quality of the entire smart city public information platform. The urban public information platform provides non-communication applications with mobile network characteristics."",,,Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences,,,,2022-07-15,2022,2022-07-15,2023-01-01,8,1,1287-1300,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Yu, Peiling";" Shatat, Abdallah Saleh"",""Yu, Peiling (King’s College London, London, UK)";" Shatat, Abdallah Saleh (College of Administrative Sciences, Applied Science University, Bahrain)"",""Yu, Peiling (King's College London)"",""Yu, Peiling (King's College London)";" Shatat, Abdallah Saleh (Applied Science University)"",0,0,,0.0,https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/amns.2022.2.0116,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151482044,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, they are challenged to find efficiency in green business models innovation and to jump to the next step of “the Green Wall” – greening their businesses.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is therefore a growing interest to investigate Green Business Model Innovation (GBMI)in Symbiosis Business Value Networks. The profitability and achievement of other values seems in Green Symbiosis Business Value Networks (GSBVN) to be much higher than classical GBMI isolated to single business model innovation. In this context the GSBVN seems to be a promising initiative and new strategic way to go – to increase transformation of business models into green business models. The GSBVNs seems by nature to be built for greening our society and businesses operations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Our hypothesis is that GSBVN could potentially achieve better results and effects on “the triple bottom line”combined with future wireless technologies and advanced sensor technologies. As 5G and beyond technologies offer better networks solutions “the Green Wall”challenges can be overcome because sensoring, measurement, calculations and monitoring the green business models and GBMI in the terms of monetary and nonmonetary values can be performed much more detailed, in real-time and for the entire lifetime of all the GSBVN’s business models. Fundamentally security, strong network constructions and trust are core to GSBVN’s growth. Embedding Future Wireless Networks (FWN)s and advanced sensor technologies seems to be able to make this become even easier, and a promising way to achieve the green business model goals of the GSBVNs and the surrounding society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is a lack of studies regarding the potential and initiatives of GBMI in GSBVN. This paper tries to fill some part of this gap by presenting some initial studies on (i) How can green business model innovation in symbiosis be defined? and (ii) How can Future Wireless Technologies support and value the innovation and evolvement of Green Business Models in Symbiosis Business Value Networks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A comparison of block error coefficient values for f-OFDM, W-OFDM and OFDM methods with mixed numerology of uplink and downlink subscriber channels of access to information resources of the telecommunications network was made. As a result of the study of compression methods using several carriers, the dominant compression method for mobile communication systems, in particular, the CP-OFDM method due to its high efficiency of spectrum use, scalability and flexibility due to the introduction of a cyclic prefix, has been determined. It is proved that the CP-OFDM compression method is free from the Doppler range shift problem, thus the range and Doppler shift estimations can be considered as independent tasks in CP-OFDM. In addition, CP-OFDM parameters such as carrier distance, guard interval size, frame length, and pilot shape can be tailored to optimize the performance and robustness of detection and data transmission. However, such advantages are based on perfect synchronization (time and frequency) between the transmitter and receiver – although perfect synchronization may not be possible, especially for bistatic scanning, where the transmitter and receiver of the scan signal are not adjacent. In this case, the cyclic prefix may not provide any advantage for quality scanning, and multiple unprefixed waveforms may be considered. The main disadvantage of rejecting the prefix is the difficulty of data detection (due to intersymbol interference), which must be eliminated. Another important challenge for scanning, where energy efficiency is extremely important, is the large PAPR of multi-carrier (prefixed or unprefixed) signals. Single-carrier compression methods, which are based on the expansion of the code area of common radar signals and communication, in which the radar characteristics are affected by sequence autocorrelation, have been studied. However, the long spreading code, which leads to good autocorrelation, reduces the spectrum utilization efficiency for communication systems. In this case, the estimation of the Doppler effect is not trivial and requires more complex algorithms. The justification of the choice of the signal modulation scheme in 5/6G radio systems has been made."",,,Herald of Khmelnytskyi National University Technical sciences,,,,2023-04-27,2023,2023-04-27,2023-04-27,319,2,48-55,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""VASYLKIVSKYI, MYKOLA"; BOLDYREVA, OLHA; VARGATYUK, GANNA;" MYHAILO, BUDASH"",""VASYLKIVSKYI, MYKOLA ()"; BOLDYREVA, OLHA (); VARGATYUK, GANNA ();" MYHAILO, BUDASH ()"",,""VASYLKIVSKYI, MYKOLA ()"; BOLDYREVA, OLHA (); VARGATYUK, GANNA ();" MYHAILO, BUDASH ()"",0,0,,0.0,http://journals.khnu.km.ua/vestnik/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/vknu-ts-2023-n2319-48-55.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158417171,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The IoT is gaining access day by day in the area of the remote monitoring system. Along with smart city concepts, intelligent patient monitoring systems and intelligent health are being developed. Combining the two, here, patients have a nurse navigation system and a doctor emergency call system. IoT improves the effectiveness of medical equipment by providing real-time monitoring of patient health, in which sensors collect data from patients with less human errors. In IoT, the patient's parameters get transmitted through medical devices via a gateway to the centralized system, where it is stored and analyzed.   Objective: In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent patient monitoring system for monitoring the patients' health condition automatically through sensors-based connected links. The system is more intelligent that it can be able to detect the critical condition of a patient by processing sensor data and instantly provides a notification to doctors/nurses as well as hospital in-charge personnel. The doctors and nurses get benefited from this system by observing their corresponding patients remotely without visiting to the particular seat of the patient.   Methods: An idea has been proposed to use the centralized processing of IoT devices along with the rigid security and privacy of the classical blockchain to overcome the computation expense challenge with blockchain and the security and privacy threat of the IoT systems. We are developing a system in the field of medical care to enhance the functioning of Medicare systems and provide patients with more ease and hassle-free procedures of the Medicare system, i.e., hospitals, laboratories, dispensaries, chemists, druggists, etc.   Results: This model helps in getting rid of this issue faced by all of us. There is a separate blockchain of different verified medical stores linked within the networks, which will be managed by the central hub based on their ratings, reviews, and stock availability.   Conclusion: The exponential expansion of blockchain technology in healthcare is also astonishing and has a tremendous impact on the industry. By assessing prior activities, the idea is proposed to use a centralized database system with more privacy and security to gap between the healthcare industry and blockchain technologies has been addressed in this paper."",Declared none.,None.,Recent Advances in Electrical & Electronic Engineering (Formerly Recent Patents on Electrical & Electronic Engineering),,,,2023-01-01,2023,2023-01-01,2023-06,16,4,449-459,Closed,Article,""Shukla, Meenu"; Sethi, Deepak; Bindal, Loveneesh; Mani, Kushal; Upadhyay, Kunal;" Sharma, Mitul"",""Shukla, Meenu (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, (, U.P., ), India)"; Sethi, Deepak (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, (, U.P., ), India); Bindal, Loveneesh (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, (, U.P., ), India); Mani, Kushal (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, (, U.P., ), India); Upadhyay, Kunal (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, (, U.P., ), India);" Sharma, Mitul (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Krishna Engineering College, Ghaziabad, (, U.P., ), India)"",""Sethi, Deepak (Dr. A.P.J.

One of its important aspects is considered: the management of the social security of the state in the context of digital transformation, attention is paid to assessing the effectiveness of the functioning of digital management tools and monitoring their quality. Based on the analysis of the essence of social security in relation to the State, society and individual, the paper determines that the main tasks of social security are: social protection and the state of protection of vital social security objects from various threats, which are the subject of monitoring. Based on the consideration and analysis of the challenges and threats to social security of the State, society and individual, the author identifies the management digital tools of social security and shows the impact of information technology (digitalization of the social sphere) on the quality of monitoring. Based on the study of the content of digitalization of the social sphere, the author concludes that information technologies in the form of various registers, information systems, social assistance services and mobile applications with mobile money ensure the implementation of social services, social assistance, social insurance and social promotion in the labor market. The article considers a promising direction of digitalization of the social sphere based on the introduction of the concept of building social network platforms, which allows combining numerous digital social protection tools, eliminating data duplication and complete updating, and using mobile communication technologies (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G), machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is concluded that such platforms allow to cover all beneficiaries, speed up the identification of beneficiaries, ensure data updates, and eliminate errors. In practice, this improves the quality of monitoring, facilitates work with the population, and allows them to register independently through applications, submit an application through a mobile application, and edit their data independently through the application. Based on the analysis of digital transformation tools, methods (models) for assessing the effectiveness of digital tools and their monitoring are identified, namely efficiency and effectiveness"; responsibility or responsiveness;" inclusiveness. The author considers the model of social protection provision, which has the following stages: explanatory (outreach) work and registration, enrollment, delivery, filing complaints and compensation for losses.

Among the many uses of natural language processing, text summarization has emerged as a critical component in information retrieval. In particular, within the past two decades, many attempts have been undertaken by researchers to provide robust, useful summaries of their findings. Text summarizing may be described as automatically constructing a summary version of a given document while keeping the most important information included within the content itself. This method also aids users in quickly grasping the fundamental notions of information sources. The current trend in text summarizing, on the other hand, is increasingly focused on the area of news summaries. The first work in summarizing was done using a single-document summary as a starting point. The summarizing of a single document generates a summary of a single paper. As research advanced, mainly due to the vast quantity of information available on the internet, the concept of multidocument summarization evolved. Multidocument summarization generates summaries from a large number of source papers that are all about the same subject or are about the same event. Because of the content duplication, the news summarization system, on the other hand, is unable to cope with multidocument news summarizations well. Using the Naive Bayes classifier for classification, news websites were distinguished from nonnews web pages by extracting content, structure, and URL characteristics. The classifier was then used to differentiate between the two groups. A comparison is also made between the Naive Bayes classifier and the SMO and J48 classifiers for the same dataset. The findings demonstrate that it performs much better than the other two. After those important contents have been extracted from the correctly classified newscast web pages. Then, extracted relevant content is used for the keyphrase extraction from the news articles. Keyphrases can be a single word or a combination of more than one word representing the news article’s significant concept. Our proposed approach of crucial phrase extraction is based on identifying candidate phrases from the news articles and choosing the highest weight candidate phrase using the weight formula. Weight formula includes features such as TFIDF, phrase position, and construction of lexical chain to represent the semantic relations between words using WordNet. The proposed approach shows promising results compared to the other existing techniques."",Conflicts of Interest The authors of this manuscript declared that they do not have any conflict of interest.,,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,,Mohammad Farukh Hashmi,,2022-06-23,2022,2022-06-23,2022-06-23,2022,1,1-15,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Arora, Amita"; Gupta, Ashlesha; Siwach, Manvi; Dadheech, Pankaj; Kommuri, Krishnaveni; Altuwairiqi, Majid;" Tiwari, Basant"",""Arora, Amita (Department of Computer Engineering, J.C.

However, the advantages of adopting massive MIMO for broadband communication are well-established. Recently researcher has been devoted to building communication systems sustaining high communication rates with security. While massive MIMO for Internet-of-Things (IoT) connectivity is still a developing issue, IoT connectivity has requirements and limitations that differ significantly from broadband connections. Although IoT makes people’s lives easier by allowing physical devices to flow through, the interaction of open wireless channels such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, Narrowband-Internet of Things (NBIoT), and WiFi, has produced various security and privacy difficulties. Identity authentication is one of the effective solutions for addressing the Internet of Things security and privacy concerns. The typical point-to-point authentication technique ignores the internet of things’ massive number of nodes and limited node resources. Group authentication is an authentication method that simultaneously confirms the identity of a group of members, offering a novel approach to identity identification for the internet of things nodes. However, existing group authentication systems appropriate for the internet of things scenarios pose security issues. They cannot withstand malicious attacks such as forging and replay and cannot prevent group managers from fooling group members. Most existing group authentication schemes are computationally expensive and cannot be applied to resource-constrained IoT scenarios. At the same time, existing systems based on secret-sharing technology cannot resist forgery attacks and replay attacks. The attacker can forge a legal token by modifying the Lagrangian coefficient in the authentication token to pass the group authentication. This work employs verifiable secret sharing technology to create a lightweight verifiable group authentication method (L-IoT-GS) suitable for Internet of Things situations to resist group managers’ deceptive group behavior. Nodes in the Internet of Things scenario can frequently join and leave the network. Because of this, this article proposes a critical update link based on a verified group authentication system for updating group Member rights. According to security analysis, the suggested L-IoT-GS scheme meets accuracy and confidentiality requirements and can withstand malicious attacks such as replay, forgery, and impersonation. Furthermore, performance study and experimental simulation reveal that the L-IoT-GS technique minimizes group members’ computing costs compared to existing standard IoT group authentication schemes."",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Physical Communication,,,,2023-06,2023,,2023-06,58,,102043,Closed,Article,""Dwivedi, Abhishek"; Agarwal, Ratish;" Shukla, Piyush Kumar"",""Dwivedi, Abhishek (Department of Computer Science Engineering, University Institute of Technology Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya (Technological University of Madhya Pradesh), Bhopal, India)"; Agarwal, Ratish (Department of Information Technology, University Institute of Technology, Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya (Technological University of Madhya Pradesh), Bhopal, India);" Shukla, Piyush Kumar (Department of Computer Science Engineering, University Institute of Technology Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya (Technological University of Madhya Pradesh), Bhopal, India)"",""Dwivedi, Abhishek (Rajiv Gandhi Technical University)"",""Dwivedi, Abhishek (Rajiv Gandhi Technical University)"; Agarwal, Ratish (Rajiv Gandhi Technical University);" Shukla, Piyush Kumar (Rajiv Gandhi Technical University)"",3,3,,2.59,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156016863,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Features of the design of the new 6G system are considered, in particular, the effective organization of data coming from completely different areas and their management, taking into account privacy protection. It was determined that the fundamental architectural difference between 5G networks and 6G networks is the built-in support for artificial intelligence in the 6G network. The architecture of the segment of the information communication network with built-in AI was studied, which is embodied in three business models: infrastructure as a service"; platform as a service;" artificial intelligence as a service. AI services running on this innovative infrastructure will bring many benefits, namely: a shift from global AI to local AI, as from a nationwide network perspective, centralized training is characterized by high cost, due to the fact that it involves collecting and sending data across the network to the central object. It is planned to develop a task-oriented communication solution that covers four main aspects: task management, resource management/scheduling during work, data management and connection management. At the same time, from an architectural point of view, it may make sense to introduce new network services and APIs for task management that implement the definition, execution, and management of tasks throughout their lifecycle. A real-time scanning model with high-precision localization and tracking of user movements by network services is proposed. A study of deep edge computing using the capability of artificial intelligence at the RAN level was performed. Opportunities to optimize resource planning and reduce interference while supporting AI based on 6G mobile networks are considered. Researched models to support the structure of AI and the resulting potential requirements for the mobile communication system are a key asset of the artificial intelligence industry. As the first wave of AI services are more focused on business-to-consumer (B2C) applications, end users are the direct data sources. The dependence of the implementation of deep learning (such as federated learning) on the main functional parameters of the communication system, i.e. throughput and delay, is determined. At the same time, the network system architecture can influence AI training and its logical results."",,,Measuring and computing devices in technological processes,,,,2022-12-29,2022,2022-12-29,,,4,62-70,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Васильківський, Микола"; Варгатюк, Ганна;" Болдирева, Ольга"",""Васильківський, Микола (Вінницький Національний Технічний Університет)"; Варгатюк, Ганна ();" Болдирева, Ольга ()"",,""Васильківський, Микола (Vinnytsia National Technical University)"; Варгатюк, Ганна ();" Болдирева, Ольга ()"",5,5,,1.99,https://vottp.khmnu.edu.ua/index.php/vottp/article/download/67/71,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154660270,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"293,pub.1163639866,10.4028/p-k3dfyn,,,New Addressable Applications for Rheocasting to Escape from an Oversupplied Market,""The current market change of aluminium HPDC castings started with the “Dieselgate”. First, there was a shift from diesel to petrol engines. In the second step, hybrid and battery-powered cars gained significant market shares in sales statistics. Therefore, lucrative powertrain components are falling away. As powertrain foundries still want to utilize their machines to capacity, they are pushing into the structural castings market. As a result, there is an oversupply of casting machines here, which massively depresses prices and, thus, margins for tenders. With rising energy costs, these declining margins were eaten up, bringing foundries into crisis. Implementing Rheocasting at the existing die-casting cells is the solution to move into new market shares that are now not accessible in conventional HPDC.One of the new applications is electronic housings, high wall thickness parts, and fatigue bearing parts. These parts are commonly manufactured in sand or gravity castings because of their high wall thickness and low tolerance of porosity. Rheocasting is the perfect process for high-wall thickness components. Because of the semisolid melt preparation and the lamellar filling behavior, these components can be manufactured from the same alloy without pores or voids.This flow behavior of the semisolid slurry also results in a longer flow length. Slower casting speeds and lower pressure settings result in lower clamping forces. This gives an advantage in production costs and targets battery constructions made of castings and sheet metal. Structural battery housings must be leak-tight, even in a crash event. Having it in one casting instead of an assembly reduces the leakage area and improves crash performance.Another industry that relies on Rheocasting is the telecommunications industry. The power electronics in these 5G modules are significantly larger and generate much more waste heat. Until now, many antennas have been actively cooled or milled from a block of aluminum. The milled housings are significantly too expensive to enable series production. Therefore, the goal is to reproduce the passively cooled modules in die casting. Due to the process, the thermal conductivity in conventional HPDC is around 120 to 130 W/m*K. Similarly, no slim cooling fins can be formed. Only the Rheocasting process makes it possible to cast other alloys with low proportions of alloying elements, such as AlSi2Mn. This allows fins with a wall thickness of down to 0.4 mm and thermal conductivity of up to 190 W/m*K.Rheocasting enables access to market segments out of reach.

"255,pub.1164015081,10.3897/biss.7.112456,,,An AI-based Wild Animal Detection System and Its Application,""Rapid accumulation of biodiversity data and development of deep learning methods bring the opportunities for detecting and identifying wild animals automatically, based on artificial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce an AI-based wild animal detection system. It is composed of acoustic and image sensors, network infrastructures, species recognition models, and data storage and visualization platform, which go through the technical chain learned from Internet of Things (IOT) and applied to biodiversity detection. The workflow of the system is as follows: Deploying sensors for different detection targets. The acoustic sensor is composed of two microphones for picking up sounds from the environment and an edge computing box for judging and sending back the sound files. The acoustic sensor is suitable for monitoring birds, mammals, chirping insects and frogs. The image sensor is composed of a high performance camera that can be controlled to record surroundings automatically and a video analysis edge box running a model for detecting and recording animals. The image sensor is suitable for monitoring waterbirds in locations without visual obstructions. Adopting different networks according to signal availability. Network infrastructures are critical for the detection system and the task of transferring data collected by sensors. We use the existing network when 4/5G signals are available, and build special networks using Mesh Networking technology for the areas without signals. Multiple network strategies lower the cost for monitoring jobs. Recognizing species from sounds, images or videos. AI plays a key role in our system. We have trained acoustic models for more than 800 Chinese birds and some common chirping insects and frogs, which can be identified from sound files recorded by acoustic sensors. For video and image data, we also have trained models for recognizing 1300 Chinese birds and 400 mammals, which help to discover and count animals captured by image sensors. Moreover, we propose a special method for detecting species through features of voices, images and niche features of animals. It is a flexible framework to adapt to different combinations of acoustic and image sensors. All models were trained with labeled voices, images and distribution data from Chinese species database, ESPECIES. Saving and displaying machine observations. The original sound, image and video files with identified results were stored in the data platform deployed on the cloud for extensible computing and storage. We have developed visualization modules in the platform for displaying sensors on maps using WebGIS to show curves of the number of records and species for each day, real time alerts from sensors capturing animals, and other parameters.

For storing and exchanging records of machine observations and information of sensors, and models and key nodes of network, we have proposed a collection of data fields extended from Darwin Core and built up a data model to represent where, when and which sensors observe which species. The system has been applied in several projects since last year. For example, we have deployed 50 sensors across the city of Beijing for detecting birds, and now they have harvested more than 300 million records and detected 320 species, filling the data gaps of Beijing birds from taxonomic coverage to time dimension effectively. Next steps will focus on improving AI models for identifying species with higher accuracy, popularizing this system in biodiversity detection, and building up a mechanism for sharing and publishing machine observations."",""We thank Yan Han, members of Institute of Zoology, CAS, for their contributions on collecting data.

The article is devoted to the investigation of the South Korean experience of the «Smart-Grids» implementation in the post-war recovery of the domestic energy system and modernization of the existing power grids in Ukraine. Analysis results. Analyzed the main provisions of «Smart Grids» in the Law of Ukraine «On Energy Efficiency», which are defined as highly intelligent power grids, which functioning due to the ICT use on the basis of the smart meters, allowing independently and efficiently distribution and to manage the power grid. Emphasized the adopted by Ukrainian Government Concept for the implementation of Smart Grids in Ukraine until 2035, the main task of which is to promote the development of national energy system strategy with the creation of a highly intelligent power grid based on the Information and Communications Technologies. It has been proven that the Republic of Korea is one of the first countries where practically implemented a project of the «Smart Grid» introduction and distribution on South-Korea's Jeju-do island, which combines the concept of «Smart City» and «Smart Factory» based on the use of renewable energy sources. Grid technology is one aspect of a general trend towards smart technologies and a large market for Korean export. Smart-Grid technologies include electrical supply grids that use demand response, connectivity and renewable energy sources which increases the energy efficiency of manufacturing entities and households. Due to the high spread of the Internet of Things all around the world the transition to «Smart-Grid» is an imperative of increasing «Smart City» and «Smart Factory» concept in the sustainable development of a State, which includes the use of wearable technologies. That is why, collecting the large amount of data requires a high speed of the internet networks, like 5G. Conclusions and directions for further research. The issue of the actualizing of bilateral collaboration in the field of «Smart Grid» between Ukraine and the Republic of Korea is extremely important for both countries, because for the successful implementation of «Smart Grid» in the existing domestic realities it is necessary to involve practical South-Korean experience and for Korean business partners – Ukraine is a potential foreign market for technological items export, which requires «Smart Grid» industry. Since the time when «Miracle on the Han River» start, the main goal of the South-Korean Government was to find stable sources of energy supply and to cover electricity demand for heavy-industry manufacturing corporations and households from the sources of cheap energy supply. To achieve such goals was established Government-owned entity «Korea Electric Power Corporation» (KEPCO) and the developing of power industry was based on the large-scale centralized power systems, main aim of which was to reduce the cost of energy for long-term South-Korean economy boost.

"233,pub.1148195785,10.1360/tb-2022-0318,,,Progress on carbon nanotube filled polymer-based thermal conductive composites,""In the 5G era, the effective thermal management has become more demanding due to the ever-rising integration of electronic devices. High thermal conductivity materials play a crucial role in the field of thermal management, for example, thermal interface materials (TIMs) are used to fill the gap between the electronic chip and the heat sink to improve thermal transfer. In recent years, polymers have become a popular choice for thermal conductive materials because of their light, economical and excellent insulation and processability. To improve the thermal conductivity of materials, inorganic fillers with high thermal conductivity are generally composited with polymers. With the merits of high thermal conductivity, desirable chemical stability, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered to have broad application potential in thermal conductive composites.Simple composition methods failed to increase thermal conductivity of composite materials to expected levels due to the large interfacial thermal resistance between CNTs and polymers and the disorderly distribution of CNTs in polymers. Therefore, reasonable design of polymer composites filled with CNTs is the key to achieving high thermal conductivity. This review mainly introduces the application of CNTs in thermal conductive polymer composites. Based on the existing theoretical research on thermal conductivity of composites and the application of molecular dynamics, more feasible strategies for improving the thermal conductivity of polymer composites filled with CNTs have been proposed. The approaches that improve the thermal conductivity of composites are mainly introduced from three aspects.(1) The intrinsic thermal conductivity of CNTs is an important factor affecting the thermal conductivity of polymer-based composites. CNTs and their macroscopic bulk materials both have excellent thermal conductivity. However, the thermal conductivity test results of the macroscopic materials of CNTs (such as CNTs fibers, arrays, and films) showed that the thermal conductivity of the macroscopic materials of CNTs was much smaller than that of single CNTs due to impurities, defects and inter-tube contact thermal resistance. Studies have shown that purification of CNTs and reduction of intertubular contact thermal resistance can improve the intrinsic thermal conductivity of CNTs.(2) From a microscopic perspective, phonons, the quantized energy of lattice vibration, are the main mechanism of heat conduction in most carbon fillers and polymers. Phonon scattering occurs in the process of phonon transfer, including the scattering between phonons and the scattering at the interface caused by defects and impurities, resulting in thermal resistance. The bonding strength of fillers and polymer interfaces are the crucial factors affecting the transmission of phonons. Hence, the thermal conductivity of composites could be effectively enhanced by surface treatment of CNTs, including covalent functionalization and non-covalent functionalization. Studies have shown that the functionalization can enhance the interfacial interaction between CNTs and polymers, while improving the dispersion of CNTs in polymers. (3) According to the thermal conduction network theory, the key to improving the thermal conductivity is whether the fillers can form a large number of continuous thermal conduction paths in the polymers and maintain a stable existence. However, high CNTs content usually affects the comprehensive properties of composites. To solve this problem, the arrangement and distribution of CNTs in the polymer should be improved to construct more heat conduction pathways, which can achieve high thermal conductivity at a low filling content. Here we introduce some effective methods, including the synergy effect, field orientation and the construction of 3D network structures. In this review, the characteristics and improvement effects of different technical approaches are summarized, which provides a reference for the research and application of CNT-filled polymer-based composites with high thermal conductivity. Finally, the future development prospects of carbon nanomaterial-filled polymer composites are discussed from perspectives of theoretical research, experimental design and engineering application."",,,Chinese Science Bulletin (Chinese Version),,,,2022-05-26,2022,2022-05-26,2022-10-01,67,30,3531-3545,Closed,Article,""Shi, Song"; Zhang, Chuanqi; Zhang, Da;" He, Yan"",""Shi, Song ()"; Zhang, Chuanqi (); Zhang, Da ();" He, Yan ()"",,""Shi, Song ()"; Zhang, Chuanqi (); Zhang, Da ();" He, Yan ()"",2,1,,0.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148195785,34 Chemical Sciences"; 3403 Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry; 40 Engineering; 4016 Materials Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Scopus and Web of Science entries were used as the information base for the study. The systematized publications were selected by “smart city” in their subjects and keywords. Also, the selection of studies targeted scientific papers only (except for conference proceedings and other publications), which helped evaluate and systematize more comprehensive and substantial Web of Science and Scopus works on smart cities. The paper considers a set of related aspects that have determined the development of smart city research, among which are the accelerating digitalization rates in all socio-economic aspects in modern society, the urbanization of territories, the increasing burden on the environment, and more intensive exploitation of various resources. This systematization of publications by the specified parameters outlined the main areas of research, which develop the concept of smart cities. To visualize the research trends and directions in the field of urban environment digitalization and the implementation of smart city ideas, a research tree was built that reflects the author’s idea of the development of research on smart cities. The paper notes that the main areas where the research on smart cities is globally developing seem to be related to such aspects as smart city infrastructure, smart city management, social and innovative development of smart cities. These aspects are highlighted as the main ones in designing the research tree in this paper. The scientific novelty of the results obtained lies in the systematization of research on smart cities and the identification of the main development trends in this field of knowledge.

These windows can be utilized in various settings, such as vehicles or buildings. The proposed unit cells, designed to be wide-incident angle and polarization insensitive, are implemented in both single-glazing and double-glazing glasses, arranged in a periodic structure to form the transmission surfaces. Both metasurfaces maintain optical transparency by incorporating Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) as the conductive element in each unit cell. These engineered transmission surfaces enhance the 5G signal indoor coverage at the 3.5 GHz band across a broad range of incident angles. While multi-layer structures typically exhibit heightened sensitivity to the angle of incidence, the proposed two-layered transmissive surfaces demonstrate substantial angular stability, reaching up to 65 and 75 degrees for double- and single-glazed glass, respectively. To achieve this wide and stable angular response, evolutionary optimization techniques were employed to fine-tune the proposed unit cells. Both designs exhibit a high transmission coefficient across the operating frequency for a variety of incident angles, surpassing those reported in the existing literature. Experimental evaluations of the fabricated prototypes indicate that both metasurfaces hold significant potential for enhancing signal propagation into buildings and vehicles."",,,Scientific Reports,,,,2024-03-21,2024,2024-03-21,,14,1,6832,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Bagheri, Amirmasood"; Danesh, Shadi; Wang, Fan; Hosseininejad, Seyed Ehsan; Khalily, Mohsen;" Tafazolli, Rahim"",""Bagheri, Amirmasood (5G & 6G Innovation Centres (5GIC & 6GIC), Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, Guildford, UK)"; Danesh, Shadi (5G & 6G Innovation Centres (5GIC & 6GIC), Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, Guildford, UK); Wang, Fan (Shanghai Huawei Technologies Company Ltd, 201206, Shanghai, China); Hosseininejad, Seyed Ehsan (5G & 6G Innovation Centres (5GIC & 6GIC), Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, Guildford, UK); Khalily, Mohsen (5G & 6G Innovation Centres (5GIC & 6GIC), Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, Guildford, UK);" Tafazolli, Rahim (5G & 6G Innovation Centres (5GIC & 6GIC), Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, GU2 7XH, Guildford, UK)"",""Khalily, Mohsen (University of Surrey)"",""Bagheri, Amirmasood (University of Surrey)"; Danesh, Shadi (University of Surrey); Wang, Fan (Huawei Technologies (China)); Hosseininejad, Seyed Ehsan (University of Surrey); Khalily, Mohsen (University of Surrey);" Tafazolli, Rahim (University of Surrey)"",4,4,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51447-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169951183,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is the first to practically build a two-way FSO-HCF-UWOC converged system with high-speed and long-distance optical wireless-wired-underwater wireless communication characteristics. It shows a 5G NR FSO-HCF-UWOC convergence from drone or buildings to undersea, using R/G/B 3-wavelengths and an SLM as a demonstration. The R/G/B 3-wavelengths are used to enhance the downstream and upstream aggregate transmission rates. An SLM with electrical comparator is used to adjust the laser beam and mitigate laser beam misalignment caused by drone movement or ocean flow. Over a hybrid of 1-km FSO, 10-m HCF, and 10.44-m ocean water-air-ocean water medium, downstream/upstream 5G-millimeter-wave (MMW) 9.1-Gb/s/24-GHz signals are transmitted with satisfactorily low bit error rates and error vector magnitudes, as well as distinct constellations. This demonstrated that the 5G NR FSO-HCF-UWOC converged system exhibits promising potential as it advances the scenario implemented by the 5G-MMW signals over FSO, HCF, and UWOC convergence, paving the way for high-speed and long-distance communications across diverse media."",""This work was funded in part by the National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan (111-2221-E-027-031-MY3), in part by the Hsinchu Science Park Emerging Technology Application Program (112AO02B), in part by the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.

Traditional glass windows lack adequate thermal insulation and heat retention capabilities"; Low-Emissivity (Low-E) glass can block external infrared radiation, it also impedes mobile communication signals, particularly those in the 5G Sub6G frequency band. This paper introduces an innovative metasurface glass designed to enhance 5G mobile communication signals within the interior of glass windows. Through simulation and experimental validation, this design has demonstrated a signal enhancement of over 10 dB within a 150 mm range before and after the focal point, and 100 mm in the vertical direction, compared to ordinary glass;" at the focal point, the signal enhancement exceeds 15 dB. Furthermore, tests conducted across various real-world scenarios have confirmed that within areas covered by 5G signals, the RSRP of the signal at the focal point has increased by approximately 6-9 dB. In addition, the outer surface of this metasurface glass possesses low-emissivity characteristics, effectively blocking external infrared thermal radiation and reducing heat exchange with the interior of the glass window, thereby showing a significant advantage in maintaining a stable indoor temperature."",Acknowledgements National Key R&amp";D Program of China (2022YFB3806204);" National Natural Science Foundation of China (61971341).

The antenna is engineered to feature low sidelobe levels (SLL), which enhance signal clarity and reduce interference. The proposed antenna utilizes a novel approach, directly exciting all radiating slots through the cavity layer, thus eliminating the need for a complex and lossy power dividing network. The antenna’s performance is validated through full-wave simulations and measurements. The results demonstrate antenna’s ability to achieve wideband operation from 3.1 to 4 GHz with − 19 dB SLL, peak gain of 20.2 dBi, and more than 90% total efficiency. The main advantages provided by the proposed slot arrays are wide bandwidth, high radiation efficiency, high gain, low sidelobe levels. The all-metal construction ensures robust power handling, and the simplified design contributes to its low complexity.

To this end, network designers propose energy-efficient approaches to reduce energy consumption of networks and to raise network performance by switching off the links/nodes with low loads or at idle status. The existing energy-efficient approaches can be formulated as a max–min optimal problem, namely maximizing network/node/port throughput via minimum energy consumption. The max–min planning investigates energy efficiency only from the links/nodes perspective. The max–min planning for energy-efficient networking, if not carefully designed from the network-wide standpoint, can lead to lower energy efficiency for the whole network due to lack of global planning, which in turn results in the degraded performance due to network un-connectivity after closing the nodes/links. In this paper we rethink the max–min planning framework on energy-efficient software-defined networking for intelligent networking of 5G networks, which takes in account combining network connectivity and maximum network flow with minimum energy consumption. Our framework aims at how to deliver dynamic end-to-end traffic demands with the appropriate network topology by building data forwarding plane with maximum network flow and control plane with network connectivity. We discuss the associated challenges and implementation issues. A dynamic max–min planning framework depending on dynamic end-to-end traffic demands is presented to achieve network-wide energy efficiency.

First, AI software has continuously evolved, expanding the range of eye diseases that can be screened, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and progressing towards predicting the course of eye diseases. However, inadequate infrastructure such as 5G and a shortage of specialized personnel have hindered the coverage of screenings. Second, while the cost-effectiveness of AI is well-established, new screening models have impacted the equity of screenings. It is essential to tailor AI application models to the specific context of China. Third, AI screening guidelines have been increasingly improved, providing direction for AI development and reference for the promotion and application of AI technologies. Nonetheless, high-quality empirical research is urgently needed to provide scientific evidence for policymaking related to AI in the eye disease screening. Therefore, it is suggested to develop multimodal AI models that integrate basic data such as symptoms and medical history with simple ophthalmic examinations, to accelerate the construction of infrastructure like 5G and focus on cultivating interdisciplinary talents, to explore suitable service systems and models for the large-scale eye disease screening tailored to local conditions, and to conduct long-term, multi-center, empirical studies."",,,Chinese Journal of Ophthalmology,,,Humans"; Artificial Intelligence; China; Eye Diseases; Mass Screening; Primary Health Care,2024-10-11,2024,,2024-10-11,60,10,799-803,Closed,Article,邹海东; 林森林; 陆丽娜; 徐艺,邹海东 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080); 林森林 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080); 陆丽娜 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080); 徐艺 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080),邹海东 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080),邹海东 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080); 林森林 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080); 陆丽娜 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080); 徐艺 (上海市眼病防治中心　上海市眼科医院　同济大学附属眼科医院　上海交通大学医学院附属第一人民医院眼科　国家眼部疾病临床医学研究中心　上海市眼底病重点实验室　上海眼视觉与光医学工程技术研究中心　上海市眼科疾病精准诊疗工程技术研究中心，上海　200080),0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1181126644,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3212 Ophthalmology and Optometry; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Among the metasurface family, free-form metasurfaces excel in achieving intricate spectral responses compared to regular-shape counterparts. However, conventional numerical methods for free-form metasurfaces are time-consuming and demand specialized expertise. Alternatively, recent studies demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs. The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses. In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug discovery."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The modules proposed in the first part of this work differ in their actuation voltage, topology, and desired attenuation level. Fabricated samples of basic 1-bit attenuation modules, characterized by a moderate footprint of 690 × 1350 µm2 and aiming at attenuation levels of -2, -3, and -5 dB in the 24.25-27.5 GHz range, are presented in their variants featuring both low actuation voltages (5-9 V) as well as higher values (~45 V), the latter ones ensuring larger mechanical restoring force (and robustness against stiction). Beyond the fabrication non-idealities that affected the described samples, the substantial agreement between simulations and measurement outcomes proved that the proposed designs could provide precise attenuation levels up to 40 GHz, ranging up to nearly -3 dB and -5 dB for the series and shunt variants, respectively. Moreover, they could be effective building blocks for future wideband and reconfigurable RF-MEMS attenuators. In fact, in the second part of this work, combinations of the discussed cells and other configurations meant for larger attenuation levels are investigated."",,This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,,,2024-04-05,2024,2024-04-05,,24,7,2308,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Tagliapietra, Girolamo"; Giacomozzi, Flavio; Michelini, Massimiliano; Marcelli, Romolo; Sardi, Giovanni Maria;" Iannacci, Jacopo"",""Tagliapietra, Girolamo (Center for Sensors and Devices (SD), Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), 38123 Trento, Italy";, gtagliapietra@fbk.eu, (G.T.);, giaco@fbk.eu, (F.G.);, m.michelini-1@studenti.unitn.it, (M.M.)); Giacomozzi, Flavio (Center for Sensors and Devices (SD), Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), 38123 Trento, Italy;, gtagliapietra@fbk.eu, (G.T.);, giaco@fbk.eu, (F.G.);, m.michelini-1@studenti.unitn.it, (M.M.)); Michelini, Massimiliano (Center for Sensors and Devices (SD), Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), 38123 Trento, Italy;, gtagliapietra@fbk.eu, (G.T.);, giaco@fbk.eu, (F.G.);, m.michelini-1@studenti.unitn.it, (M.M.)); Marcelli, Romolo (CNR-IMM, 00133 Roma, Italy;, romolo.marcelli@cnr.it, (R.M.);, giovannimaria.sardi@cnr.it, (G.M.S.)); Sardi, Giovanni Maria (CNR-IMM, 00133 Roma, Italy;, romolo.marcelli@cnr.it, (R.M.);, giovannimaria.sardi@cnr.it, (G.M.S.)); Iannacci, Jacopo (Center for Sensors and Devices (SD), Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), 38123 Trento, Italy;, gtagliapietra@fbk.eu, (G.T.);, giaco@fbk.eu, (F.G.);", m.michelini-1@studenti.unitn.it, (M.M.))"",""Iannacci, Jacopo (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)"",""Tagliapietra, Girolamo (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)"; Giacomozzi, Flavio (Fondazione Bruno Kessler); Michelini, Massimiliano (Fondazione Bruno Kessler); Marcelli, Romolo (CNR-IMM, 00133 Roma, Italy;, romolo.marcelli@cnr.it, (R.M.);, giovannimaria.sardi@cnr.it, (G.M.S.); CNR-IMM, 00133 Roma, Italy;, romolo.marcelli@cnr.it, (R.M.);, giovannimaria.sardi@cnr.it, (G.M.S.)); Sardi, Giovanni Maria (CNR-IMM, 00133 Roma, Italy;, romolo.marcelli@cnr.it, (R.M.);, giovannimaria.sardi@cnr.it, (G.M.S.); CNR-IMM, 00133 Roma, Italy;, romolo.marcelli@cnr.it, (R.M.);, giovannimaria.sardi@cnr.it, (G.M.S.));" Iannacci, Jacopo (Fondazione Bruno Kessler)"",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/7/2308/pdf?version=1712306614,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170494006,""40 Engineering"; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware;" 46 Information and Computing Sciences"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This new environment requires a smarter network, including transforming the simple electricity customer into a “smart customer” who values the quality of energy and its rational use. The SPG (smart power grid) is the perfect solution for meeting these needs. It is crucial to understand energy use to guarantee quality of service and meet data security requirements. The use of simulations to map the behavior of complex infrastructures is the best strategy because it overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical solutions. This article presents the ICT laboratory structure developed within the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Polytechnic School of the Universidade de São Paulo (USP). It is based on an architecture that utilizes LTE/EPC wireless technology (4G, 5G, and B5G) to enable machine-to-machine communication (mMTC) between SPG elements using edge computing (MEC) resources and those of smart city platforms. We evaluate this proposal through simulations using data from real and emulated equipment and co-simulations shared by SPG laboratories at POLI-USP. Finally, we present the preliminary results of integration of the power laboratory, network simulation (ns-3), and a smart city platform (InterSCity) for validation and testing of the architecture."",,This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES)—Finance Code 001.,Sensors,,""Omprakash Kaiwartya, Fco Javier Rodríguez"",,2025-03-01,2025,2025-03-01,,25,5,1517,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Rodrigues, Luiz H.

Here, the Fe3O4@C@NiO nanoprisms with unique tip shapes, asymmetric multi-path hollow cavity, and core-shell heteroepitaxy structure are designed and synthesized based on anisotropy and intrinsic physical characteristics. Impressively, by changing the load of NiO, the composites achieve strong absorption, broadband, low-frequency absorption: the reflection loss of -55.8 dB and the absorption bandwidth of 9.9 GHz covers both low and high frequency (2.9-6.1 and 11.3-18 GHz). The constructed anisotropic hollow and heterointerface nanoprisms can optimize impedance matching for low-frequency absorption (3.8-7.9 GHz) almost completely covering the 5G band. Especially, the influence of hollow path on the interface polarization and ferromagnetic coupling behavior is revealed through the simulation of electric and magnetic field distribution using the High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). In addition, HFSS simulation shows that the Radar Cross-Sectional (RCS) value of the absorber at any angle is <-10 dB m2, which meets the complex requirements in practical application. This research paves a new way for the development of efficient low-frequency absorbers based on composition and structure design."",""Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge the support of this work by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFB3803802), the National Science and Technology Major Project (No. 2017‐VI‐0008‐0078), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1560106).

Additionally, coding and chessboard metasurfaces are specifically tailored for radar cross-section reduction (RCS). Initially, a compact unit cell demonstrating exceptional polarization conversion performance is introduced, achieving a polarization conversion ratio (PCR) exceeding 90%$$\%$$ across frequencies ranging from 7.9 to 22.7 GHz. The PCR remains effective even when oblique incidence angles of up to 30∘$$^\circ$$ are utilized across this frequency band. Roger RT5880, with a thickness of 0.254 mm, serves as the substrate. An airgap is introduced between the substrate and the ground plane to enhance the polarization conversion bandwidth. This unit cell serves as the fundamental building block for subsequent metasurface configurations. To assess the scalability and effectiveness, a 36 ×$$\times$$ 36 unit array is assembled, confirming efficient polarization conversion capabilities extending to larger structures. Moreover, a 1-bit coding unit “0” and “1” are formed by the Pancharatnam-Berry phase based on the same-sized meta-atom with 90∘$$^\circ$$ orientations. The robustness and practicality of the design are demonstrated by creating 12 ×$$\times$$ 12 lattices and evaluating their RCS reduction potential under two distinct scenarios: a chessboard pattern and a coding-based scheme. Notably, its results indicate substantial RCS reduction across a broad frequency spectrum (7.9 to 22.7 GHz) for both configurations. This study demonstrates the wide-ranging applicability of metasurface design, making it a valuable contribution to the fields of microwave engineering, polarization control, and radar stealth technology. Owing to its simplicity, bandwidth, and versatility, this approach offers innovative solutions for diverse real-world applications."",""This study was supported by a research fund from Chosun University, 2023."",,Scientific Reports,,,,2024-04-09,2024,2024-04-09,,14,1,8262,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Ahmad, Ashfaq";" Choi, Dong-You"",""Ahmad, Ashfaq (Information and Communication Engineering, Chosun University, 61452, Gwangju, South Korea)";" Choi, Dong-You (Information and Communication Engineering, Chosun University, 61452, Gwangju, South Korea)"",""Choi, Dong-You (Chosun University)"",""Ahmad, Ashfaq (Chosun University)";" Choi, Dong-You (Chosun University)"",10,10,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59054-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170529322,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful tools for in situ electromagnetic field assessments due to their flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to operate in challenging environments. This paper highlights various UAV applications, from testing large-scale antenna arrays, such as those used in the square kilometer array (SKA), to evaluating channel models for 5G/6G networks. Additionally, the review discusses technical challenges, such as positioning accuracy and antenna alignment, and it provides insights into the latest advancements in portable measurement systems and antenna designs tailored for UAV use. During the UAV-based antenna measurements, key contributors to the relatively small inaccuracies of around 0.5 to 1 dB are identified. In addition to factors such as GPS positioning errors and UAV vibrations, ground reflections can significantly contribute to inaccuracies, leading to variations in the measured radiation patterns of the antenna. By minimizing ground reflections during UAV-based antenna measurements, errors in key measured antenna parameters, such as HPBW, realized gain, and the front-to-back ratio, can be effectively mitigated. To understand the source of propagation losses in a UAV to ground link, simulations were conducted in CST. These simulations identified scattering effects caused by surrounding buildings. Additionally, by simulating a UAV with a horn antenna, potential sources of electromagnetic coupling between the antenna and the UAV body were detected. The survey concludes by identifying key areas for future research and emphasizing the potential of UAVs to revolutionize antenna and propagation measurement practices to avoid the inaccuracies of the antenna parameters measured by the UAV."",,This research was supported by the European Union through the Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks Programme “Mobility and Training for beyond 5G Ecosystems (MOTOR5G)” under grant agreement no. 861219.,Sensors,,""Carlos Tavares Calafate, Andrzej Łukaszewicz, Dimitrie Popescu, Wojciech Giernacki"",,2024-11-20,2024,2024-11-20,,24,22,7395,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Kandregula, Venkat R."; Zaharis, Zaharias D.; Ahmed, Qasim Z.; Khan, Faheem A.; Loh, Tian Hong; Schreiber, Jason; Serres, Alexandre Jean René;" Lazaridis, Pavlos I."",""Kandregula, Venkat R.

"1920,pub.1183256034,10.3390/s24237849,39686386,PMC11644862,Improving Monitoring of Indoor RF-EMF Exposure Using IoT-Embedded Sensors and Kriging Techniques,""Distributed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used to enhance the quality and safety of various applications. These networks consist of numerous sensor nodes, often deployed in challenging terrains where maintenance is difficult. Efficient monitoring approaches are essential to maximize the functionality and lifespan of each sensor node, thereby improving the overall performance of the WSN. In this study, we propose a method to efficiently monitor radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) exposure using WSNs. Our approach leverages sensor nodes to provide real-time measurements, ensuring accurate and timely data collection. With the increasing prevalence of wireless communication systems, assessing RF-EMF exposure has become crucial due to public health concerns. Since individuals spend over 70% of their time indoors, it is vital to evaluate indoor RF-EMF exposure. However, this task is complicated by the complex indoor environments, furniture arrangements, temporal variability of exposure, numerous obstructions with unknown dielectric properties, and uncontrolled factors such as people's movements and the random positioning of furniture and doors. To address these challenges, we employ a sensor network to monitor RF-EMF exposure limits using embedded sensors. By integrating Internet of Things-embedded sensors with advanced modeling techniques, such as kriging, we characterize and model indoor RF-EMF downlink (DL) exposure effectively. Measurements taken in several buildings within a few hundred meters of base stations equipped with multiple cellular antennas (2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G) demonstrate that the kriging technique using the spherical model provides superior RF-EMF prediction compared with the exponential model. Using the spherical model, we constructed a high-resolution coverage map for the entire corridor, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach."",,This work was funded by the Deanship of Graduate Studies and Scientific Research at Jouf University under grant No. (DGSSR-2024-02-01156).,Sensors,,,Wireless Technology"; Radio Waves; Humans; Electromagnetic Fields; Internet of Things; Computer Communication Networks,2024-12-08,2024,2024-12-08,,24,23,7849,All OA;" Gold,Article,""Jabeur, Randa";" Alaerjan, Alaa"",""Jabeur, Randa (Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka 72341, Saudi Arabia.)";" Alaerjan, Alaa (Department of Computer Science, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka 72341, Saudi Arabia.)"",""Alaerjan, Alaa (Al Jouf University)"",""Jabeur, Randa (Al Jouf University)";" Alaerjan, Alaa (Al Jouf University)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/s24237849,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183256034,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"1913,pub.1170371020,10.1088/1361-648x/ad399c,38565125,,The 2024 magnonics roadmap,""Magnonicsis a research field that has gained an increasing interest in both the fundamental and applied sciences in recent years. This field aims to explore and functionalize collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials for modern information technologies, sensing applications and advanced computational schemes. Spin waves, also known as magnons, carry spin angular momenta that allow for the transmission, storage and processing of information without moving charges. In integrated circuits, magnons enable on-chip data processing at ultrahigh frequencies without the Joule heating, which currently limits clock frequencies in conventional data processors to a few GHz. Recent developments in the field indicate that functional magnonic building blocks for in-memory computation, neural networks and Ising machines are within reach. At the same time, the miniaturization of magnonic circuits advances continuously as the synergy of materials science, electrical engineering and nanotechnology allows for novel on-chip excitation and detection schemes. Such circuits can already enable magnon wavelengths of 50 nm at microwave frequencies in a 5G frequency band. Research into non-charge-based technologies is urgently needed in view of the rapid growth of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, which consume substantial energy when implemented on conventional data processing units. In its first part, the 2024 Magnonics Roadmap provides an update on the recent developments and achievements in the field of nano-magnonics while defining its future avenues and challenges. In its second part, the Roadmap addresses the rapidly growing research endeavors on hybrid structures and magnonics-enabled quantum engineering. We anticipate that these directions will continue to attract researchers to the field and, in addition to showcasing intriguing science, will enable unprecedented functionalities that enhance the efficiency of alternative information technologies and computational schemes."",""B F acknowledges support from the NSF under Grant No. NSF DMR-2144086.

Thermally conductive materials with high thermal conductivity and extensive mechanical flexibility are extremely desirable in practical applications. However, the construction of efficient interconnected conductive pathways and continuous conductive networks is inadequate for either processing or actual usage in existing technologies. In this work, spherical copper nanoparticles (S-CuNPs) and urchin-inspired fractal-growth CuNPs (U-CuNPs), thermally conductive metal fillers induced by ionic liquids, were fabricated successfully through the electrochemical deposition method. Compared to S-CuNPs, the U-CuNPs shows larger specific surface contact area, thus making it easier to build a continuous conductive pathway network in the corresponding U-CuNPs/liquid silicone rubber (LSR) thermally conductive composites. The optimal loading of CuNP fillers was determined by evaluating the rheological performance of the prepolymer and the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity performances of the composites. When the filler loading is 150 phr, the U-CuNPs/LSR produces optimal mechanical properties (e.g., tensile strength and modulus), thermal conductivity (above 1000% improvement compared to pure LSR), and heating/cooling efficiency. The enhanced thermal conductivity of U-CuNPs/LSR was also confirmed through the finite element analysis (FEA) overall temperature distribution, indicating that U-CuNPs with larger specific surface contact areas exhibit more advantages in forming a continuous network in composites than S-CuNPs, making U-CuNPs/LSR a promising and competitive alternative to traditional flexible thermally interface materials."",""This work was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2023M742989), the “Pioneer” and “Leading Goose” R&amp";"D Program of Zhejiang (2023C01185), the Research and Development Program of Quzhou (2022Z03 and 2023K020), and the Research Funds of Institute of Zhejiang University–Quzhou (IZQ2023KJ2002 and IZQ2023KJ3011)."",,ACS Applied Bio Materials,,,Thermal Conductivity"; Materials Testing; Copper; Particle Size; Surface Properties; Metal Nanoparticles; Fractals; Biocompatible Materials,2024-09-02,2024,2024-09-02,2024-09-16,7,9,6297-6305,All OA;" Hybrid,Article,""Hou, Xiao"; Shen, Fangming; Chen, Mingzhou; Song, Lina; Liu, Quan; Ren, Yongyuan; Zhan, Xiaoli;" Zhang, Qinghua"",""Hou, Xiao (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China"; Institute of Zhejiang University-Quzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Innovation Center of Advanced Chemicals Technology, Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Shen, Fangming (Zhejiang Youngdream Li-ion Co., Ltd., Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Chen, Mingzhou (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China; Institute of Zhejiang University-Quzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Innovation Center of Advanced Chemicals Technology, Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Song, Lina (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China); Liu, Quan (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China; Institute of Zhejiang University-Quzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Innovation Center of Advanced Chemicals Technology, Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Ren, Yongyuan (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China; Institute of Zhejiang University-Quzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Innovation Center of Advanced Chemicals Technology, Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Zhan, Xiaoli (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China; Institute of Zhejiang University-Quzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Innovation Center of Advanced Chemicals Technology, Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Zhang, Qinghua (Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Advanced Chemical Engineering Manufacture Technology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China;" Institute of Zhejiang University-Quzhou, Zhejiang Provincial Innovation Center of Advanced Chemicals Technology, Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China)"",""Zhang, Qinghua (Zhejiang University";" Zhejiang University)"",""Hou, Xiao (Zhejiang University"; Zhejiang University); Shen, Fangming (Zhejiang Youngdream Li-ion Co., Ltd., Quzhou, Zhejiang, 324000, China); Chen, Mingzhou (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Song, Lina (Zhejiang University); Liu, Quan (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Ren, Yongyuan (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Zhan, Xiaoli (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University); Zhang, Qinghua (Zhejiang University;" Zhejiang University)"",0,0,,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsabm.4c00905?ref=article_openPDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175328935,40 Engineering"; 4016 Materials Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The design is based on bisecting the conventional microstrip line BLC transversely and folding bisected sections on double-layered substrates with a common ground plane in between. The input and output terminals, each with a length of λg/4, and the pair of quarter-wavelength horizontal parallel arms are converted into a Z-shaped meandered microstrip line in the designed structure. Conversely, the pair of quarter-wavelength vertical arms are halved into two lines and transformed into a periodically loaded slow-wave structure. The bisected parts of the BLC are placed on the opposite side of the doubled-layer substrate and connected through four vias passing through the common ground plane. This technique enabled a compact BLC size of 6.4 × 18 mm2, which corresponds to a surface area miniaturization by ~50% as compared to the classical BLC size of 10 × 23 mm2 at 6 GHz. Moreover, the attained relative bandwidth is 73.9% (4.6-10 GHz) for S11, S33, S21, and the phase difference between outputs (&ang";S21 - &ang;S41). However, if a coupling parameter (S41) of up to -7.5 dB is considered, then the relative bandwidth reduces to 53.9% (4.6-10 GHz) for port 1 as the input. Similarly, for port 3 as the input, the obtained bandwidth is 75.8% (4.5-10 GHz) for S33, S11, S43, and the phase difference between outputs (&ang;S43 - &ang;"S23). Likewise, this bandwidth reduces to 56% (4.5-8 GHz) when a coupling parameter (S23) of up to -7.5 dB is considered. In contrast, the relative bandwidth for the ordinary BLC is 41% at the same resonant frequency. The circuit is constructed on a double-layered low-cost FR4 substrate with a relative permittivity of 4.3 and a loss tangent of 0.025. An isolation of -13 dB was realized in both S13 and S31 demonstrating an excellent performance. The transmission coefficients between input/output ports S21, S41, S23, and S43 are between -3.1 dB to -3.5 dB at a frequency of 6 GHz. Finally, the proposed BLC provides phase differences between output ports of 90.5° and 94.8° at a frequency of 6 GHz when the input ports 1 and 3 are excited, respectively. The presented design offers the potential of being utilized as a unit cell for building a Butler matrix (BM) for sub-6 GHz 5G beamforming networks."",,This research received no external funding.,Micromachines,,Haejun Chung,,2024-01-17,2024,2024-01-17,,15,1,142,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Ahmed, Fayyadh H"; Saad, Rola;" Khamas, Salam K"",""Ahmed, Fayyadh H (Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S1 3JD, UK.)"; Saad, Rola (Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S1 3JD, UK.);" Khamas, Salam K (Communications Research Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S1 3JD, UK.)"",""Ahmed, Fayyadh H (University of Sheffield)"",""Ahmed, Fayyadh H (University of Sheffield)"; Saad, Rola (University of Sheffield);" Khamas, Salam K (University of Sheffield)"",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/15/1/142/pdf?version=1705481186,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168035452,""40 Engineering";" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Currently, 5G coverage extends to most areas throughout the country. However, coverage issues persist not only in rural areas but also in high-rise buildings in urban areas. Consequently, a study was conducted within such buildings. This paper assesses the performance of 5G at different altitude test points. The chosen location for the field tests was a high-rise building within a crowded public hospital, which receives numerous patients every weekday, in the major urban area of Bangkok. Two smartphones from the same manufacturer, both supporting 5G technology and equipped with the Speedtest application, were employed as tools for this study. Tests were carried out on the third and twenty-fourth floors of the high-rise building for data collection. The primary finding of this study reveals that download speeds exhibited a significant decrease with increasing altitude of the test points, as evidenced by statistical analysis (p-values<0.001). This implies an issue with altitude-induced variations, indicating a need for the improvement of indoor 5G coverage in high-rise buildings."",,,Bulletin of Electrical Engineering and Informatics,,,,2025-02-01,2025,2025-02-01,,14,1,197-206,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Daengsi, Therdpong"; Sriamorntrakul, Pakkasit; Chatchalermpun, Surachai;" Phanrattanachai, Kritphon"",""Daengsi, Therdpong (Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon)"; Sriamorntrakul, Pakkasit (Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon); Chatchalermpun, Surachai (Southeast Asia University);" Phanrattanachai, Kritphon (Phetchabun Rajabhat University)"",,""Daengsi, Therdpong (Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon)"; Sriamorntrakul, Pakkasit (Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon); Chatchalermpun, Surachai (Southeast Asia University);" Phanrattanachai, Kritphon (Phetchabun Rajabhat University)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.11591/eei.v14i1.8425,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1182641676,33 Built Environment and Design"; 3301 Architecture; 40 Engineering,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"930,pub.1167789553,10.1016/j.enconman.2023.118043,,,An optimal siting and economically optimal connectivity strategy for urban green 5G BS based on distributed photovoltaic energy supply,""The emergence of ultra-dense 5G networks and a large number of connected devices will bring with them significant increases in energy consumption, operating costs, and CO2 emissions. At the same time, the deployment of distributed photovoltaic (DPV) in megacities plays an important role in promoting the integration of “building-photovoltaic”, adjusting the city's clean energy supply system, and building a green, and low-carbon smart city. The development of a new “DPV-5G Base Station-Energy Storage (DPV-5G BS-ES)” coupled DC microgrid system and its pre-deployment investment costs are fundamental factors to be considered when the problem of large-scale DPV and BS deployment in cities has to be addressed. There are almost no published papers on this issue in the literature, which only consider the problem of maximizing the deployment of 5G BS service coverage or only perform optimization analyses for the performance of microgrid systems without considering the economic optimality and low-carbon green issues in the construction of urban utilities. In order to solve the problem of 5G BS deployment and economic optimization of topology in the “DPV-5G BS-ES” coupled DC microgrid system, a novel deployment strategy is proposed in this paper. The strategy is divided into: (a) The Geographic Information System (GIS) for extracting and analyzing 3D data from all buildings in the area. (b) A GIS-based formulation of a mixed integer quadratic constrained planning model (BSSCP) under discrete fixed radius coverage constraints is used to delineate building clusters within the area and determine the optimal deployment location of 5G BS under each sub-cluster. (c) An Improved Self-Organizing Mapping (ISOM) model combines GIS and microgrid performance parameters to address the economically optimal connection of grid lines for DPV in 3D space. (d) Simulation experiments were conducted for the power output and profitability of eight different PV panels and tracking systems to calculate the economically optimal type of DPV generation hardware. The experimental results show that the BSSCP model proposed in this study reduced the 5G BS deployment cost input by up to 35.8974 % compared to that of the control experimental model. Meanwhile, the ISOM model obtained an average reduction of 52.3741 % in the cost of connecting cables for the optimized 25 DPV planning and DC microgrid topology."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This paper selects several typical scenes (Open spaces, building concentration areas, user and building intensive areas) for electromagnetic radiation monitoring, and analyzes the relationship between ambient radiated power density and base station background. The results show that the factors that have significant impacts on the environmental radiation power density of 5G base stations including transmission distance, base station distribution, user density, building reflection superposition and so on. The radiation energy decays rapidly with distance. When the density of the building distribution is too large, the superposition effect caused by the reflected wave is concentrated at the distance of 50-70 meters. When the user density decreases (the superposition effect of reflected waves decreases), the 5G monitoring value follows the direct wave attenuation law and decreases rapidly with the increase of distance. Points with higher measured radiation in the simple access condition also had higher measured radiation in the high-speed download condition. With the popularization of 5G mobile phones and the increase of user density, the resource utilization of a single user will decline to the normal operation state, and the radiation environmental impact will be further reduced."",The work was supported by the Ecological Environment Research Project of Jiangsu Province: 5G Base station radiation environment monitoring technology and environmental impact research (No. 2020014).,,Radiation Detection Technology and Methods,,,,2024-02-21,2024,2024-02-21,2024-09-01,8,3,1333-1341,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Wei, Qing"; Ge, Xiaoyang; Liu, Jiaxue;" Li, Haijie"",""Wei, Qing (Jiangsu Radiation Environmental Protection Consultation Limited Company, No.75 Yunlongshan Road, Jianye District, 210019, Nanjing, China)"; Ge, Xiaoyang (Jiangsu Suhe Radiation Technique Limited Company, No.75 Yunlongshan Road, Jianye District, 210019, Nanjing, China); Liu, Jiaxue (Tourism and Social Administration College, Nanjing XiaoZhuang University, No.3601, Hongjing Avenue, Jiangning District, 211171, Nanjing, China);" Li, Haijie (School of Environmental Science, Nanjing Xiaozhuang University, No.3601, Hongjing Avenue, Jiangning District, 211171, Nanjing, China)"",""Wei, Qing (Jiangsu Radiation Environmental Protection Consultation Limited Company, No.75 Yunlongshan Road, Jianye District, 210019, Nanjing, China)"",""Wei, Qing (Jiangsu Radiation Environmental Protection Consultation Limited Company, No.75 Yunlongshan Road, Jianye District, 210019, Nanjing, China)"; Ge, Xiaoyang (Jiangsu Suhe Radiation Technique Limited Company, No.75 Yunlongshan Road, Jianye District, 210019, Nanjing, China); Liu, Jiaxue (Nanjing Xiaozhuang University);" Li, Haijie (Nanjing Xiaozhuang University)"",1,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s41605-024-00452-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169059617,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, current illegal building detection methods have low detection accuracy and high calculation costs. Therefore, a method for detecting illegal building activities by identifying illegal building-related objects is proposed. A lightweight and high-precision detector and a dataset including 14,038 images of 29 categories of illegal building objects are proposed. The proposed detector is an enhanced version of YOLOv4. MobileNetV3 is utilized as the backbone to extract features, which greatly improves the detection accuracy. Further, depthwise separable convolution (DSC) is introduced to optimize the model structure and lower calculation costs and parameters. Furthermore, Mish was utilized to enhance the identification precision, generalization, and robustness of the detector. Experimental results revealed that the mean average precision (mAP) value of the detector is 88.79% with the dataset. Compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors, this detector exhibited superior performance in identifying illegal construction objects, which can detect and prevent illegal building activities accurately and timely, enhancing the development of smart cities.

However, the introduction of new techniques usually raises new security threats. Most of the existing works on 5G security only focus on 5G itself and do not analyze 5G network slicing security in detail. We consider network slices as a virtual logical network that can unite the subnetwork parts of 5G. If a 5G network slice has security problems or has been attacked, the entire 5G network will have security risks. In this paper, after synthesizing the existing literature, we analyze the security threats step by step through the lifecycle of 5G network slices, analyzing and summarizing more than 70 security threats in three major categories. Based on the security issues investigated, from a viewpoint of building a secure 5G network slicing system, we compiled 24 security requirements and proposed the corresponding recommendations for different scenarios of 5G network slicing.

In this paper, we use the model checker SPIN to perform a formal analysis of the 5G EAP-TLS authentication protocol. Firstly, we analyze the process of the 5G EAP-TLS authentication protocol and abstract it to obtain a formal model of the protocol. Then, we describe the construction of the protocol model based on the Promela language. The unique feature of this paper is the replacement of the hash value of the 5G EAP-TLS authentication protocol with the message content field encrypted by an unknown subject public key. This is because the Promela language in SPIN has an eval function that can check the value of each field. This can replace the function of the hash function and make the Promela model construction more portable. The paper analyzes the attack paths of the protocol and reveals design flaws that undermine the expected identity authentication attributes and secret consistency of the protocol. The results not only provide a comprehensive understanding of the security properties of the 5G EAP-TLS authentication protocol but also offer valuable insights and guidance for the verification of the protocol's security properties, security design, and optimization of protocol implementation and interoperability."",,,South African Computer Journal,,,,2024,2024,,2024,21,1,21-36,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Wang, Qianli"",""Wang, Qianli (Software School, East China JiaoTong University, Nanchang, China)"",,""Wang, Qianli (East China Jiaotong University)"",0,0,,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=1820-02142300068W,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1165610867,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has established security standards for the 5G systems, including mechanisms, such as 5G-authentication and key agreement (5G-AKA), which enable secure sessions with untrustworthy participants or insecure channels. The private key with untrustworthy parties has been independently or transmitted through insecure channels, which may involve a risk of information leakage in 5G-AKA. Motivated by this challenge, we propose a practical and secure dual-server key agreement scheme based on password authentication for the IoT devices in the 5G networks. The scheme ensures secure reliable key storage and key transmission, mitigating the risks associated with key information leakage through a dual-server architecture and a three-lock security policy. Importantly, we avoid ownership of the complete key by any untrustworthy entity in an insecure 5G network to ensure key security. The scheme can be resilient to various security threats prevalent in 5G networks through rigorous formal security.

For example 5G benefits the environment in two ways: it helps telecom operators reduce their energy usage, thus lowering their environmental impact, and it provides tools that telecom companies can use to assist others in reducing their environmental footprint. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression method was used to establish the correlations between the five factor groups. Research indicates a prevalent skepticism among Hungarian consumers toward 5G technology, characterized by apprehensions regarding health risks and a lack of perceived competitive advantages or inherent business benefits to adopting 5G. This hesitancy must be countered by transparently addressing health concerns, debunking myths, and building a foundational trust in 5G technologies through comprehensive educational and awareness-raising initiatives, aligning technological advancements with consumer confidence and acceptance. 5G must be demystified so that consumers will come to trust the technology and embrace its adoption. Due to the similar technological conditions and historical backgrounds of the Central European Countries (CEC), the results of this research will prove useful to policymakers throughout the region."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,2024-08,2024,,2024-08,467,,142964,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Balassa, Boglárka Eisinger"; Nagy, Nikolett Gyurián;" Gyurián, Norbert"",""Balassa, Boglárka Eisinger (Széchenyi István University, Kautz Gyula Faculty of Economics, Department of Leadership and Marketing, Egyetem tér 1, 9026, Győr, Hungary)"; Nagy, Nikolett Gyurián (Széchenyi István University, Kautz Gyula Faculty of Economics, Department of Leadership and Marketing, Egyetem tér 1, 9026, Győr, Hungary);" Gyurián, Norbert (J.

The increasing trend of both antenna element and array physical size makes massive MIMO antenna pattern measurement in the direct‐far‐field OTA environment unrealistic due to the signal attenuation, long measurement time, and ultra‐high test system construction cost. Therefore, the necessity of a compact, efficient, low‐complex, yet accurate OTA test method is evident, especially for 5G massive MIMO BS arrays. This paper proposes a novel multi‐probe‐enabled midfield (MF) OTA test method for 5G massive MIMO devices in compact measurement settings where antenna pattern measurement can be efficiently performed. The detailed theoretical analysis for the 5G massive MIMO array MF antenna pattern reconstruction method is presented, and the simulated validation results based on the typical 5G BS antenna arrays are provided and analysed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MF OTA test method and can provide insights into the radio frequency parametric measurement for 5G massive MIMO devices."",""Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFF0604300), and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61821001).

In this manuscript, hierarchical auto‐associative polynomial convolutional neural network with gorilla troops optimization (GTO) is proposed for path loss modeling in mmWave 5G‐IoT mobile communication systems (HA‐PCNN‐PLM‐mWC‐5G). The input images depicting buildings and roadways are obtained from Google Maps and enhanced local area multiscanning (E‐LAMS) with distance dependencies are used to improve feature learning. Here, the improved bilateral texture filtering (IBTF) is applied to reduce noise in the input images and enhance image quality. Additionally, the spatial and spectral features are then extracted using the fast discrete curvelet transform with wrapping (FDCT‐WRP), and these features are fed into the HA‐PCNN model for path loss prediction.

This study was conducted to model the outdoor propagation path loss of mmWaves in four Nigerian cities at 28, 38, 60, and 73 GHz for 5G mobile systems: Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan, and Port Harcourt. The study utilised simulation data from a Composite Raytracing-Image-Method propagation model in MATLAB 2023a with OpenStreetMap 3D building maps to formulate the Close-In free-space Reference Distance (CI), Floating Intercept (FI), and Alpha–Beta-Gamma (ABG) large-scale path loss models. This model considered the specific atmospheric conditions, terrain, building materials and structures, and geographical layouts of each site. The study found that the path loss exponent ranged from 2.712 to 3.819 in line-of-sight scenarios, with shadow fading standard deviation (σCI) ranging from 11.778 to 37.199. In non-line-of-sight scenarios, the path loss exponent ranged from 3.375 to 5.033, with σCI ranging from 12.441 to 44.181 across the four frequencies studied. The ABG model consistently provided the most accurate predictions compared to CI and FI, particularly the mean absolute error and root mean square error values. However, performance varied across cities, frequencies, and scenarios, with Port Harcourt exhibiting the highest path loss values across all frequencies and scenarios, followed by Lagos. Furthermore, the omnidirectional large-scale path loss increases marginally as the frequency increases, except at 60 GHz, which had a higher path loss per distance than 73 GHz. Finally, the findings showed that the propagation characteristics of mmWaves for 5G networks in sub-Saharan tropical environments, such as Nigeria, exhibit significant variability based on factors such as atmospheric conditions, terrain, building materials, and geographical layouts. The formulated path loss models can be used to predict the coverage area and signal quality of millimetre-wave communication systems at these frequencies and locations."",The authors thank the Redeemer’s University and Durban University of Technology for the privileges given and the anonymous reviewers.,No external funding was used.,Discover Applied Sciences,,,,2024-09-16,2024,2024-09-16,,6,10,495,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Afape, Johnson O."; Willoughby, Alexander A.; Sanyaolu, Modupe E.; Obiyemi, Obiseye O.; Moloi, Katleho;" Dairo, Oluropo F."",""Afape, Johnson O.

"740,pub.1181668030,10.1109/tits.2024.3480525,,,Leveraging Single-Bounce Reflections and Onboard Motion Sensors for Enhanced 5G Positioning,""5G-based mmWave wireless positioning has emerged as a promising solution for autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning in recent years. Previous studies have highlighted the benefits of fusing line-of-sight (LoS) 5G signals with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for an improved positioning solution. However, the highly dynamic environment of urban areas, where AVs are expected to operate, poses a challenge, as non-line-of-sight (NLoS) communication can deteriorate the 5G mmWave positioning solution and lead to erroneous corrections to the INS. To address this challenge, we exploit 5G single-bounce reflections (SBRs) and LoS signals to improve positioning performance in dense urban environments. In addition, we integrate the proposed 5G-based positioning with a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a wheel encoder. Moreover, the integration is realized using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as an alternative to the widely utilized extended Kalman filter (EKF) within the 5G-based positioning research community. We performed two test trajectories in the dense urban environment of downtown Toronto, Canada. For each trajectory, quasi-real 5G measurements were generated using a ray-tracing tool incorporating 3D map scans of real-world buildings, allowing for realistic NLoS and multipath scenarios. For the same trajectories, real motion data were collected from two different low-cost IMUs. Our integrated positioning solution was capable of maintaining a level of accuracy below 30 cm for approximately 97% of the time, which is superior to the accuracy level achieved when SBR signals are not considered, which is only around 92% of the time."",,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) under Grant ALLRP-560898-20 and Grant RGPIN-2020-03900.,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2024-10-24,2024,2024-10-24,2024-12-01,25,12,20464-20477,Closed,Article,""Bader, Qamar"; Saleh, Sharief; Elhabiby, Mohamed;" Noureldin, Aboelmagd"",""Bader, Qamar (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen’s University, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada"; Navigation and Instrumentation (NavINST) Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON, K7K 7B4, Canada); Saleh, Sharief (Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, 412 96, Gothenburg, Sweden); Elhabiby, Mohamed (Micro Engineering Tech Inc., Calgary, AB, T2M 0L7, Canada; Public Works Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, 11566, Egypt); Noureldin, Aboelmagd (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen’s University, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada;" Navigation and Instrumentation (NavINST) Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ON, K7K 7B4, Canada)"",""Bader, Qamar (Queen's University";" Royal Military College of Canada)"",""Bader, Qamar (Queen's University"; Royal Military College of Canada); Saleh, Sharief (Chalmers University of Technology); Elhabiby, Mohamed (Micro Engineering Tech Inc., Calgary, AB, T2M 0L7, Canada; Ain Shams University); Noureldin, Aboelmagd (Queen's University;" Royal Military College of Canada)"",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1181668030,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nonetheless, conducting a thorough 5G measurement campaign is markedly laborious given the large number of samples that must be collected. To alleviate this burden, the present contribution leverages principled active learning (AL) methods to prudently select only a few, yet most informative locations to collect samples. The core idea is to rely on a Gaussian Process (GP) model to efficiently extrapolate measurements throughout the coverage area. Specifically, an ensemble (E) of GP models is adopted that not only provides a rich learning function space, but also quantifies uncertainty, and can offer accurate predictions. Building on this EGP model, a suite of acquisition functions (AFs) are advocated to query new locations on-the-fly. To account for realistic scenaria, the proposed AFs are augmented with a novel distance-based AL rule that selects informative samples, while penalizing queries at long distances. Numerical tests on 5G data generated by the Sionna simulator and on real urban and suburban datasets, showcase the merits of the novel EGP-AL approaches."",,""This work was supported by NSF under Grant 2212318, Grant 2220292, Grant 2126052, Grant 2102312, Grant 2103256, and Grant 2312547.

This study concentrates on how a CMfg platform operator can offer quality incentives to capability providers, thereby facilitating the delivery of high-quality services. Initially, game theory is employed to construct the decision-making objective functions for both platform operator and capability providers. Building on this, three incentive mechanisms are proposed: direct subsidy (DS), cost sharing (CS), and quality reward and punishment (RP)";" furthermore, the conditions necessary for effectively implementing these mechanisms are analyzed. Concurrently, the incentive effects of the three mechanisms are examined and compared to offer guidance for the platform operator in selecting appropriate quality incentive strategies. Ultimately, employing numerical simulation analysis, the incentive effects of the three mechanisms and a sensitivity analysis of crucial parameters affecting the selection of incentive strategies are conducted, thereby validating the theoretical model’s analytical conclusions. The study reveals that these mechanisms can effectively motivate capability providers to enhance quality, yet under identical incentive intensities, the RP strategy outperforms the DS strategy. Furthermore, the platform operator tends to favor the CS strategy under conditions such as higher price set, advanced technology level of the platform, fewer capabilities, greater emphasis on QoS, lower cost coefficient of QoS, and a larger number of incentivized providers."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A typical scenario of 5G shared BS planning is presented in this paper, in which different operators share the BSs constructed by the same tower company to reduce the investments. As a result, the 5G shared BS planning problem is modeled as a Bi-Level Optimization Problem (BLOP), with the tower company as the upper level decision-maker and the operators as the lower level decision-makers. The suggested bi-level 5G shared BS planning model considers constraints of various kinds involved in the real network planning scenario, therefore making it more realistic and applicable. Considering the impact of constraints, a Transfer Learning based Evolutionary Algorithm for shared BS Planning (TLEA-BSP) is introduced to solve the proposed bi-level 5G shared BS planning model. In TLEA-BSP, infeasible and feasible information can be transferred and utilized among the optimization processes of multiple lower level problems, such that the upper level and lower level optimization efficiency can be greatly improved. Experimental simulations are conducted on ten generated instances with different scales, and the effectiveness of the proposed model is confirmed by comparing the results of the bi-level model with those of two single-level 5G BS planning models. Comparing the proposed algorithm with the well-established BL-CMA-ES without using the transfer learning strategy for the bi-level 5G shared BS planning model also reveals the essential role of the transfer learning strategy."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Applied Soft Computing,,,,2024-11,2024,,2024-11,165,,112079,Closed,Article,""Chen, Lei"; Li, Kuntao;" Liu, Hai-Lin"",""Chen, Lei (School of Mathematics and Statistics, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China)"; Li, Kuntao (School of Mathematics and Statistics, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China);" Liu, Hai-Lin (School of Mathematics and Statistics, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China)"",""Liu, Hai-Lin (Guangdong University of Technology)"",""Chen, Lei (Guangdong University of Technology)"; Li, Kuntao (Guangdong University of Technology);" Liu, Hai-Lin (Guangdong University of Technology)"",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174607692,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These include the allocation of frequency spectrum, investments by cellular network operators, and the role of sectoral policies in the development of 5G technology. Spectrum allocation is a critical step in the development of 5G infrastructure, considering the regulatory authorities' role in ensuring effective frequency utilization. Operator investments in building 5G networks are a crucial factor for technological advancement and market competitiveness. Furthermore, these aspects must be assessed within the context of competition and performance growth in electronic communication services. Particularly, 5G technology represents a significant factor in enhancing network speed and capacity, offering innovative and adaptable services for users and industry. Security and privacy aspects are also crucial, emphasizing the need for effective policies and regulations to safeguard user data and ensure a reliable electronic communication environment. In this regard, it is appreciated that the development of electronic communication infrastructure, particularly with the establishment of 5G networks, has a profound impact on competitiveness, heralding a new era of advanced and personalized communication services. Another aspect involves the analysis of the market structure with two cellular operators in Albania and industry expectations for investments in 5G technology, rendering it a distinctive situation as a market dominated by a duopoly, given the absence of MVNOs, and the role of the effect reflected by the use of OTT services. The duopoly market structure can present challenges and advantages for the sector, also considered as a factor that may influence the development of 5G technology. Investments in 5G infrastructure are regarded as a crucial step to expedite progress and enhance cellular services within the country. Competition between the two operators underscores the importance of appropriate regulation to encourage investments and ensure a healthy competitive environment.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the increased number of these devices, so does the potential for health problems caused by electromagnetic radiation. However, these devices also provide a renewable energy source through their emissions. This study suggests the creation of a 5G Microstrip antenna that enhances the absorption of this radiation for the purpose of recharging batteries in smart buildings. The design capitalizes on the inherent low-profile and cost-effective features of microstrip antennas, making them well-suited for incorporation into building infrastructure and 5G wireless technologies. Although each individual device emits a little amount of energy, the combined effect achieved by advanced antenna design and power converters is anticipated to result in a substantial energy production. The antenna designer tool from MATLAB was used to carry out a conceptual simulation of the microstrip antenna.

Initially, models for the workshop, macro base stations, and micro base stations are simplified and quantified. This leads to the construction of models for minimizing base station energy consumption, minimizing base station deployment costs, and optimizing 5G network coverage. Simultaneously, full network coverage in these models serves as the cut-off condition. To find the optimal solution, this article employs an integrated algorithm that combines an improved K-means clustering algorithm with the NSGA-III algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates the Adam gradient descent method for iteration, enabling the clustering of network nodes from terminal devices in the factory. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances the algorithm’s global search and convergence capabilities.

However, fairness concerns in CSS, such as unfairness in scheduling solutions due to information asymmetry, remains inadequately addressed among existing studies. This study proposes a fairness scheduling model that considers the preferences of participants. According to real engineering practices, a multi-level CSS model with 12 objectives is established by thoroughly considering participants’ preferences, aiming to deliver equitable prices and CSS solutions. In solving the model, a clustering operation considering price fairness and inheritance operation considering participants’ preferences are designed for the developed evolutionary algorithm. Finally, a simulated case study derived from a real-world construction project demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. The results show the superior performance of the proposed model, as it recommends fairer prices and solutions to the CSS problem over the five comparator models. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm offers more fair solutions with better comprehensive performance than the NSGA3, MOEA/D, MOEA/DD, and RVEA algorithms.

There will be increase in massive number of devices. The 5G devices can be utilized in buildings, pedestrian, vehicles etc. which means that the devices should be utilized in static as well as dynamic purpose. In case of vehicles, velocity is the important parameter. The analysis of throughput, BLER and throughput fraction can be done by varying the velocity. On the other hand, due to variation in velocity, there will be Doppler Effect which causes the shift in frequency. The main cause of Doppler Effect is due to the movement of vehicles. The shift in frequency creates the variation of carrier frequency instantly and affected the throughput and BLER. For ignoring the Doppler Effect, a counter balance must be inserted at the receiver by following the Doppler Effect which will able to keep carrier frequency constant and further there will be no effect in Doppler frequency due to variation in frequency. This scenario has been specified the evaluation of throughput and BLER during the movement of vehicles without Doppler effect. It had been estimated that after a certain stage, with the increase in velocity, the throughput is decreased whereas the BLER is increased.

We examine how security may impact the envisioned 5G wireless systems and the challenges and potential solutions to aid in these efforts and define the security and privacy aspects of 5G networks. 5G networks have provided solutions for quicker machine control, problem identification, performance analysis, and data access. Interaction between Internet of Things (IoT) nodes occur across an unsecured wireless channel, which has positive and negative effects. Despite being physically separated, unauthorized nodes could communicate via an unprotected wireless channel to gather data and take over industrial devices. Secure sessions can mitigate these risks, but it might be challenging to construct a secure session over a weak channel. To address this issue, the Variable Identification (VID) is used. VID offers a simple key exchange platform to authorized Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) nodes while guarding against unauthorized use. The lightweight changeable pseudonyms used by VID for trust-building are selected at random from a pool discovered in the home network and terminal devices. All IDs are chosen at random from a pool and are used to protect data against forgery, replay, alteration, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle attacks, among other things, between the home network and terminal equipment.

To minimize capital expenditure, existing 4G cell towers are being used to install new 5G base stations (gNodeB). However, 5G has different key performance indicators (KPI), frequency and bandwidth values, and propagation models compared to 4G hence an evaluation of this approach’s effectiveness is needed. This paper analyzes 5G network performance with frequency of 3.5 GHz, bandwidth of 100 MHz, and using existing cellular towers in Surakarta City. The city has a total area of 46.8 km 2 , mostly flat topography and not many tall buildings therefore propagation models with line-of-sight urban macro (UMa) and urban micro (UMi) are representative. KPI parameters for throughput include 75% of the area served with at least 100 Mbps for downlink and at least 50 Mbps for uplink. KPI parameter for signal strength targets at least 90% of the area covered with -100 dBm or higher. Our Atoll simulations show that the optimistic scenario (UMa) produces average throughput of 153.59 Mbps (downlink) and 117.88 Mbps (uplink), 89.43% served with at least 100 Mbps (downlink) and 100% experience at least 50 Mbps (uplink), average signal strength is -83.99 dBm and 79.71% area covered with at least -100 dBm. The pessimistic scenario (UMi) predicts throughput of 141.32 Mbps (downlink) and 117.88 Mbps (uplink), 86.52% provided with at 100 Mbps (downlink) and 100% served with 50 Mbps (uplink), average signal strength of -90.73 dBm and 75.13% area covered with at least -100 dBm. It can be concluded that the 5G network installed at existing 4G towers can conform to KPI parameters on throughput but still experience drawbacks in signal coverage.

Therefore, accurate modeling of the HST wireless channels is crucial for the design and performance assessment of the 5G systems. This paper proposes a general three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary small-scale fading model for 5G HST millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which captures the wireless channel characteristics in different HST operating scenarios. The proposed channel model has two characteristics. Firstly, it incorporates the distribution of overhead line poles along the railway to characterize the periodic scattering components from the poles. Secondly, it represents complex HST operating scenarios as combinations of five types of scattering clusters, namely hills, trees, lakes, buildings, and concrete. Furthermore, the impact of environmental complexity (EC) on channel statistical properties in the 5G HST massive MIMO scenarios is investigated. Afterwards, based on the birth-death process of scattering clusters, the proposed channel model can characterize the channel non-stationarity in the space-time-frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the channel non-stationarity, the scattering characteristics of overhead line poles, and the impact of different ECs on system performance.

However, we demonstrate that its heavy reliance on infrastructure base stations significantly limits its positioning ability in urban environments, where multi-story buildings and urban canyons are the norm, resulting in only a small fraction of devices being positioned, often only in 2D. To this end, we propose CAMP, a novel, collaboration-augmented paradigm for 2D and 3D positioning with cellular networks, where UEs leverage 5G NR's peer-peer Sidelink protocol to directly enable positioning measurements between each other in a scalable manner. Leveraging better connectivity (higher degree and SNR) between devices, CAMP overcomes the challenges inherent to infrastructure approaches. It brings algorithmic innovations in distributed, stochastic access and dynamic resource scheduling in a 5G-compliant manner to Sidelink measurements that are otherwise not scalable in conventional gNB-driven Sidelink operation. CAMP is implemented as a near real-time xApp service in the Open-RAN framework. Evaluations in a small cell 5G test-bed and a large-scale RAN on Colosseum, highlight its ability to position over 80% (72%) UEs with under 3m accuracy in 2D (3D) in real-world urban scenarios (compared to 30% with infrastructure approaches) and with 7-25x less overhead compared to baseline collaborative schemes."",,,Proceedings of the ACM on Networking,,,,2024-11-25,2024,2024-11-25,2024-12,2,CoNEXT4,1-21,Closed,Article,""Lin, Yu-Tai"; Matson, N.

Our research uncovers causal relations among several network characteristics represented in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A specific causal link between latency and downlink throughput is further analyzed unveiling a robust correlation between network utilization and latency, manifesting the factors of packet loss and retransmissions especially when the network infrastructure becomes overwhelmed.

This is the first study to perform network planning simulations that account for vegetation and building-induced propagation challenges on a city-wide scale, providing understanding of their effects on 5G network performance and exposure. The study also explores the influence of user height, examining how vegetation’s blocking and shielding effects vary with user height. By evaluating both sub-6 GHz and mmWave networks under various simulated scenarios, the research qualifies the dual role of vegetation as both a coverage barrier and a mitigator of user exposure. Key findings include a significant 14.71% reduction in coverage for sub-6 GHz networks in the presence of vegetation and a 42.98% decrease in downlink whole-body SAR in mmWave networks due to vegetation’s shielding effects. Flexible base station placement is shown to effectively counteract coverage losses while maintaining stable exposure metrics, but mmWave networks remain highly sensitive to environmental obstructions. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating vegetation and other environmental factors into network planning, especially for high-frequency 5G networks, to ensure optimal performance and limit user exposure."",,This work was supported by the Enhancing the Investigation of RF-EMF and its Possible Effects on Human Health and Biodiversity (ETAIN)-Project under Grant 101057216.,IEEE Access,,,,2025-01-01,2025,2025-02-03,2025-01-01,13,,23902-23912,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Schampheleer, Jorn"; Huss, Anke;" Deruyck, Margot"",""Schampheleer, Jorn (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium)"; Huss, Anke (Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands);" Deruyck, Margot (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium)"",""Schampheleer, Jorn (Ghent University)"",""Schampheleer, Jorn (Ghent University)"; Huss, Anke (Utrecht University);" Deruyck, Margot (Ghent University)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2025.3538054,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1185207770,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In response, this study proposes a real-time monitoring and intelligent data analysis system based on Fifth-Generation Mobile Communication Network (5G) technology. Building upon an analysis of the limitations inherent in traditional systems, the experiment capitalizes on the extensive connectivity capabilities of 5G to design an intelligent monitoring architecture tailored for power plant production environments.

Guided by the concept of infrastructure as a site and tool of political contestation, we develop a new approach to the study of Internet governance and standard-setting processes that leverages web scraping and computer-assisted document set discovery software tools. We bring these methods into conversation with theoretical approaches from material media studies, science and technology studies, and international relations. The 3GPP is the main telecommunications standardisation body and the only consortium developing standards to fulfil the ITU’s criteria for the 5th generation of telecommunications technology (5G). The 3GPP therefore is a strategic venue to observe and interpret the politics of standardisation processes. As such, the LI-related work conducted in 3GPP exemplifies public and private actors’ capacity to influence global surveillance standards and export their surveillance technologies. While European and United States governments engage in the standardisation of surveillance technologies, the Chinese government does not do this in the 3GPP. This fuels distrust in 5G technologies.

This paper introduces the theoretical basis of multi-mode filter, and on the basis of theoretical calculation and analysis, a novel 5G cavity multi-mode resonator and filter is designed by using ads/HFSS simulation software. The electric field characteristic of resonator is analyzed, and the mutual coupling between modes is realized by the way of screw perturbation. The electric field distributions of the mode is changed by adding tuning screws, two coupled degenerate modes act as two coupled resonators, so that the numbers of resonator can be reduced while keeping the resonance loop unchanged. For example, the characteristics of 3N section filter can be realized in the physical space of a traditional n-section filter by using three modes of a resonator, thus greatly reducing the volume of the filter. The results show that in the pass-band (3.5 GHz ~ 3.6 GHz): return loss > 17.9 dB, standing wave ratio < 1.29, insertion loss < 0.31 dB, a transmission zero point is introduced at 4 GHz on the right side of the pass-band, which makes the right side out of band attenuation rapidly.

To reduce the energy consumption of 5GBS, this article incorporates 5GBS into power demand side management and proposes a flexible resource collaborative optimization method that integrates 5GBS with virtual power plants (VPPs). Firstly, starting from the basic structure of 5GBS, the adjustable potential of 5GBS and the paths for participating in VPP optimization were analyzed. Secondly, with the minimum operating cost as the optimization objective and considering the constraints of 5GBS and various decentralized resources, a demand side decentralized resource collaborative optimization model for VPP integrating 5GBS was established. This model can be solved using the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm. The results indicate that the participation of 5GBS in power demand side management can reduce their comprehensive energy consumption and operating costs."",""Dongjuan Ma (Conceptualization [equal], Investigation [equal], Methodology [equal]), Zehui Liu (Formal analysis [equal], Visualization [equal], Writing—original draft [equal]), Min Guo (Visualization [equal], Writing—original draft [equal]), Weizhe Jing (Software [equal], Supervision [equal], Visualization [equal]), Feng Jing (Visualization [equal], Writing—original draft [equal]), Rui Li (Validation [equal], Writing—review &amp";" editing [equal]), Hua Yang (Methodology [equal], Visualization [equal]) and Huiping Zheng (Formal analysis [equal], Supervision [equal], Visualization [equal]).

The development of 5G networks and subsequent generations is accompanied by the development of new services, in particular, virtual, augmented reality services, as well as telepresence, as well as radio access networks.  In particular, there is an increase in operating frequencies, which poses additional challenges for organizing a network that can meet the requirements for the quality of traffic service from new services and ensure the availability of communication to users.  These problems can be solved by various methods of placing access points, including using UAVs.  This approach ensures the efficiency of construction and flexibility of the access network structure, but also requires the use of methods for placing access points in relation to users and other elements of the communication network.    Problem statement:  development of methods for placing routers in a UAV swarm and selecting traffic routes when organizing an access network, in order to improve the efficiency of the communication network.    Purpose of the work  : improving the efficiency of building an access network using UAVs through the development of clustering methods and distributing routers in a UAV swarm.    Methods.   The studies were carried out using the provisions of information theory, mathematical optimization methods, graph theory methods and clustering methods.  The numerical results were obtained using the numerical simulation method in Python.    Result  .  The developed model and methods allow for the distribution of network routers (access points) located on UAVs taking into account the quality of service and ensuring the construction of a connected mesh network and its connection with the mobile network, which can be used in both modern and future communication networks.    Novelty  : a modeling and methodological apparatus has been developed that allows for increasing the efficiency of building wireless access networks using UAVs, in particular, allowing for selecting the placement positions of routers in a UAV swarm and the logical structure of the network.  The developed modeling and methodological apparatus solves the problem of traffic routing taking into account the quality of its service.

It enables the users to use new applications like mobile gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), as well as industrial & building automation systems that require bulk amount of data. Recent forecasts show that IoT devices would exceed 50 billion and create enormous amounts of data, much more than what many devices can handle. Traditional cloud computing, known as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), has struggled to keep up with these demands. MCC faces problems like high latency, data privacy concerns, and limited bandwidth because it relies on centralized servers. This makes it unsuitable for the fast and secure data processing needed for 5G and IoT. To solve these problems, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) was introduced by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). MEC moves computing resources closer to the users, usually to base stations on the edge of the network. This ensures low latency in data transfer and related services. Soon after the launching MEC was renamed as Multi-access Edge Computing to show its use beyond just mobile networks. There are several technologies that enhance Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) for improved 5G experiences which involves cloud computing, software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV) network slicing, and computation offloading. So, by using these techniques MEC ensures, the significant reduction in latency as compared to cloud computing having single central server for data applications."",,,International Journal of Sciences and Emerging Technologies,,,,2025-03-11,2025,2025-03-11,,3,1,,Closed,Article,""Arshad, Wasif"",""Arshad, Wasif ()"",,""Arshad, Wasif ()"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1186547253,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy;" 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

D2D data transmission over wireless channels among mobile devices is vulnerable to security threats and privacy violations from third parties and relay nodes. However, academia and industry have yet to propose relevant schemes or standards for D2D relay data transmission scenarios. We first propose a generic construction for D2D relay communication in this paper. Then, a concrete anonymous and secure D2D data transmission scheme with trajectory tracking is presented based on Chebyshev polynomials, hash-based message authentication code, and symmetric encryption. We employ a formal verification tool - Tamarin, modal logic analysis - BAN logic, and informal security analysis to demonstrate the security features of the proposed scheme. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme can achieve desirable efficiency compared with other related schemes.

Objective:: According to the actual demand of multi unmanned boats' cooperative operation, a method of multi unmanned boats cooperative obstacle avoidance based on 5G edge computing is proposed to realize the unified planning and scheduling of multi unmanned boats.   Methods:: Firstly, 5G technology and Kubeedge edge computing tools are used to build a multi unmanned boat collaborative obstacle avoidance system based on cloud, edge and end collaboration, and the Kubeedge edge computing platform was optimized by optimizing communication strategies, building a highly available Kubeedge cluster, building a Harbor image center, and using Web management interfaces further to improve the reliability and stability of the system. Secondly, the YOLOR-Deepport multi-target recognition and tracking algorithm based on cloud, edge and end collaborative network is used to complete the recognition and tracking tasks of obstacle targets, and a set of EECBS path planning methods based on the Kubedge centralized control platform is designed to plan collision-free and efficient paths for each unmanned boat in realtime. Finally, the effectiveness of the system was verified through simulation experiments.   Results:: The experimental results show that compared to the traditional autonomous planning obstacle avoidance method for unmanned boats, the collaborative planning obstacle avoidance method proposed in this paper can exhibit excellent performance in dense and narrow scenarios, with a more reasonable navigation path, a range reduction of 20% - 50%, and higher safety.

However, the reliability of ReRAM is susceptible to sneak-path interference within the crossbar array structure. To mitigate the combined effects of the sneak-path interference and channel noise, the advanced channel coding technology, the polar coding scheme, is implemented in the ReRAM channel. Given the asymmetric and signal dependent nature of the states of memory cells in the ReRAM channel, two channel symmetrize schemes based on density evolution (DE) construction are proposed. The first scheme proceeds with DE separately for ReRAM channels with no sneak path and full sneak path. It then combines these two cases using a weighted approach. The second scheme involves symmetrizing the ReRAM channel based on adding the ternary output, followed by DE to construct polar codes for ReRAM channels.

This review explores the intersection of these two domains, highlighting the importance of advancements in energy storage and 5G technology for a sustainable and connected future. Energy storage is crucial for balancing the supply and demand of electricity in modern power systems. Traditional energy storage methods, such as batteries and pumped hydro, have limitations in terms of scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Next-generation energy storage technologies, including advanced batteries, hydrogen storage, and thermal storage, offer promising solutions to overcome these limitations. These technologies enable efficient energy storage at scale, facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind into the grid. By storing excess energy generated during periods of low demand, next-generation energy storage systems ensure a reliable and stable power supply, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. In parallel, the evolution of telecommunications technology, particularly the advent of 5G networks, is revolutionizing connectivity and communication. 5G technology offers significantly higher data transfer speeds, lower latency, and increased network capacity compared to its predecessors. These capabilities are essential for supporting emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, and smart grids. With 5G-enabled IoT devices, utilities can monitor energy consumption in real-time, optimize grid operations, and detect and respond to faults more efficiently. Moreover, 5G connectivity enhances the efficiency and reliability of energy storage systems by enabling seamless communication between distributed energy resources and grid operators. The convergence of next-generation energy storage and 5G technology presents numerous opportunities for driving innovation in both energy and telecommunications sectors. One of the key areas of innovation is the development of smart energy storage systems equipped with 5G connectivity. These systems can autonomously adjust their operation based on grid conditions, weather forecasts, and energy demand patterns, optimizing energy storage and distribution in real-time. Furthermore, advanced energy management algorithms leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms can optimize energy usage and storage, further improving the efficiency and reliability of the grid. Another area of innovation lies in the integration of renewable energy resources with 5G-enabled microgrids.

Furthermore, advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries and flow batteries, are enhancing the performance and reliability of energy storage systems. Solid-state batteries offer higher energy density, faster charging rates, and improved safety compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. Flow batteries, on the other hand, provide scalability and long-duration storage capabilities, making them suitable for grid-scale applications. Integrating these advanced battery technologies with 5G-enabled monitoring and control systems enhances the overall resilience and flexibility of the energy infrastructure. In addition to technological advancements, driving innovation in energy and telecommunications requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including policymakers, regulators, industry players, and research institutions. Policies and regulations should incentivize the deployment of next-generation energy storage and 5G infrastructure, promote interoperability standards, and ensure data privacy and security. Public-private partnerships can facilitate the investment and deployment of innovative solutions, while research and development initiatives can spur further technological advancements. Driving innovation in energy and telecommunications through next-generation energy storage and 5G technology is essential for building a sustainable, connected, and resilient future. By leveraging advanced energy storage systems, smart grids, and 5G-enabled communication networks, we can optimize energy usage, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance the reliability and efficiency of our energy infrastructure.

The code construction is suitable for correcting burst errors that are introduced by PPM. Simulation results show that the LDPC codes can provide a very significant real gain, provided that the code rate is chosen appropriately. We find that the code rates that minimize the bit-error-probabilities (BEPs) of the system range between 2 / 3 and 22 / 26 , with higher code rates being required in receivers that operate under increased optical noise. It is also shown that a comparable real gain is obtained for both the sum–product and min-sum decoders, while the power penalty of the latter one is only limited to 0.2 dB, when the aforementioned code rates are utilized."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Physical Communication,,,,2024-02,2024,,2024-02,62,,102255,Closed,Article,""Yiannopoulos, Konstantinos";" Sagias, Nikos C."",""Yiannopoulos, Konstantinos (Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Peloponnese, Akadimaikou G.K.

These guarantees can be provided by network slicing, which is currently enabled by the virtualization and cloudification of mobile networks, following the 5G/6G core service-based approach and the cloud-native Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) principles. However, a significant challenge arises when considering the movement of end users: ensuring network slice continuity as they transition between different network operators. In this paper, we introduce a novel cloud-native orchestration framework for network slice federation that incorporates well-defined interfaces to exchange federated service and slice resource templates among operators. The proposed framework is fully compliant with i) standardized slice service models, and ii) GSMA efforts that are building the fundamental aspects for Edge Federation to allow the sharing of network resources across mobile operators. To validate our approach, we have designed and deployed a cloud-native federated 5G experimental platform. An extensive series of experiments have been carried out, revealing that the federation implementation directly influences federation time, and the operator's slice deployment strategy significantly impacts both infrastructure and end user performance."",,""This work was supported in part by 5GMED through EC-H2020 Programme under Grant 951947, in part by the FREE-6G under Grant TSI-063000-2021-144, in part by SUCCESS-6G under Grant TSI-063000-2021-39/40/41, and in part by 6G-OASIS through the UNICO5G-RPTR Programme under Grant TSI-063000-2021-24."",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2024-02-08,2024,2024-02-08,,73,7,9306-9319,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Dalgitsis, Michail"; Cadenelli, Nicola; Serrano, Maria A.; Bartzoudis, Nikolaos; Alonso, Luis;" Antonopoulos, Angelos"",""Dalgitsis, Michail (Nearby Computing, 08006, Barcelona, Spain)"; Cadenelli, Nicola (Nearby Computing, 08006, Barcelona, Spain); Serrano, Maria A.

Reflectarrays are being considered for 5G/6G systems because of its benefits such as because of its high gain, beam shaping, beam scanning, reconfigurability, and multi-beam capabilities. Reflectarrays are effective, although their narrowband nature has limited their use. This work comprehensively investigates the present condition of broadband reflectarrays. Wideband reflectarrays are evaluated and categorized according to four wideband phase tuning techniques. The bandwidth is analyzed and contrasted between a unit cell and reflectarray system, emphasizing the gain-bandwidth performance. Different wideband unit cell shapes are examined and categorized based on the method used for wideband phase adjustment. An analysis is conducted on how different wideband phase tuning methods affect the gain-bandwidth performance of reflectarrays. Factors taken into consideration include operating frequency, reflection phase range, substrate structure and material, aperture size, aperture efficiency (AE), focal distance, cross-polarization performance, gain, and side lobe levels.

However, precise visualization of the biopsy needle trajectory remains challenging due to specular reflection, speckle noise, and needle-like anatomical features. This paper proposes a visual feedback prediction framework for ultrasound-assisted percutaneous kidney biopsy in 5G remote surgery, aiming to enhance operator confidence, reduce procedure time, and minimize the risk of unintended bleeding. Building upon this framework, we design a Lightweight-Accuracy Needle Trajectory Prediction (LA-NTP) model by minimizing the backbone and optimizing the multi-module prediction process, incorporating innovative training strategies (i.e., angle-aware geometric and trajectory augmentation losses). The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance with only 20.3% of the model size of the previous best real-time method and a 3.7-fold increase in inference speed.

"630,pub.1176040134,10.1109/access.2024.3469631,,,Investigation and Enhancement of Radio Frequency Signal Losses of Glassy Window,""This paper presents a wide incident angle, wideband, and polarization-insensitive unit cell frequency-selective surface (FSS) on single- and double-glazing glass. The 5G signal losses due to the shielding of building materials lead to high penetration losses that degrade the data rates, energy, and spectral density. The transmission coefficient of glass is lower than that of the materials used in buildings. So, investigating and enhancing radio frequency signal losses on glassy windows at sub-6GHz frequency band is crucial to increase the transmission coefficient. This paper uses three different transparent materials: ITO-PET film, silver nanowires (AgNWs) on a polymer substrate, and silver on a pet substrate as an FSS coating material for glassy windows to enhance the transmission coefficient at the n77 and n78 bands. The optimization of unit cell parameters was implemented using the Trust Region Framework (TRF) algorithm. The investigation for single and double glazing has shown that the thicker the glass, the lower the transmission coefficient. Moreover, the simulation result of the proposed FSS can support up to ${85}^{o}$ and ${75}^{o}$ for single- and double-glazing glass, respectively. A maximum of 17 dB enhancement was obtained from single-glazing glass, and a maximum of 10 dB enhancement was obtained from double-glazing glass. Thus, the designed FSS structure can enhance 5G signal transmission from outdoors to indoors."",,""This work was supported in part by Multimedia University Research and Development Malaysia, and in part by the Telekom Research and Development (TM R&D) Academic Co-Creation Project under Grant RTMP/000268: WBT-BIOM."",IEEE Access,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-09-27,2024-01-01,12,,141878-141889,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Seng, Joseph Tang Ching"; Tiang, Jun Jiat; Muhammad, Surajo;" Lo, Yew Chiong"",""Seng, Joseph Tang Ching (Centre for Wireless Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, 63100, Malaysia)"; Tiang, Jun Jiat (Centre for Wireless Technology, Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, 63100, Malaysia); Muhammad, Surajo (Research and Innovation Development Division, Telekom Research and Development (TM R&D), TM Innovation Centre, Cyberjaya, 63000, Malaysia);" Lo, Yew Chiong (Faculty of Engineering, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, 63100, Malaysia)"",""Seng, Joseph Tang Ching (Multimedia University)"; Tiang, Jun Jiat (Multimedia University);" Muhammad, Surajo (Research and Innovation Development Division, Telekom Research and Development (TM R&D), TM Innovation Centre, Cyberjaya, 63000, Malaysia)"",""Seng, Joseph Tang Ching (Multimedia University)"; Tiang, Jun Jiat (Multimedia University); Muhammad, Surajo (Research and Innovation Development Division, Telekom Research and Development (TM R&D), TM Innovation Centre, Cyberjaya, 63000, Malaysia);" Lo, Yew Chiong (Multimedia University)"",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2024.3469631,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1176040134,""40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering;" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The FR4 substrate used in the construction of the designated antenna has a thickness of 1.6 mm, a relative permittivity of 4.4, and loss tangent values of 0.02. The proposed MIMO architecture consists of four equilateral triangle‐shaped antenna elements on top and ground with inverted L‐shaped stubs on the substrate's bottom layer. The ground structure of the antenna is a connected ground and is formed by defected ground parts which are connected with inverted L‐shaped stubs. The orthogonal structure of the MIMO antenna elements, with four armed square stubs among them, enhanced the isolation between surrounding antennas. The proposed four‐port MIMO antenna is built and tested in to validate design, scattering, and radiation performance, as well as MIMO diversity features. The designed antenna has more than 15 dB isolation and operates at 4.75 GHz from 4.45 to 5.2 GHz (5G sub‐6 GHz N79 band) and 6.3 GHz from 5.95 to 7.15 GHz (WiFi‐6E band). Furthermore, the design provides omnidirectional patterns, high gain (6.5dBi) and efficiency (>95%), a low envelope correlation coefficient (<0.00001) and acceptable diversity gain (10 dB), a good total active refraction coefficient (−10 dB) and low channel capacity loss (0.03 bit/s/Hz), and a considerable mean effective gain (MEG = −3 dB) and MEG ratio (0 dB).

The application of 5G networks in this field has gradually alleviated the supply-demand response issues associated with large-scale distributed power sources. However, the broadcast nature of 5G channels raises concerns about secure data transmission. Addressing these challenges, this paper establishes a collaborative communication model for large-scale Demand Response (DR). Using the distributed power source network as a foundation, a communication system based on Power Line Communication (PLC) and Generic State Machine (GenSM) is proposed.

"627,pub.1173518649,10.20535/2411-2976.12024.18-27,,,AUTHENTICATION OF WIRELESS SYSTEMS BASED ON A DRONE SWARM AS A COMPONENT OF THE 5G RADIO ACCESS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE,""Background. When establishing security measures for telecommunication networks involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), characteristics such as high scalability, device diversity, and high mobility should be considered. Authentication is a fundamental property that allows a UAV network to establish secure communication between its core components. Authentication also protects the UAV network from attackers impersonating legitimate UAVs. UAV authentication can further secure the communication channel by preventing impersonation and replay attacks. The design of UAV access control schemes, such as authorization and authentication mechanisms, remains a challenging research problem in UAV networks. The network becomes even more complicated when it interacts with a multitude of UAVs, called a swarm. A swarm by its very nature has a dynamic structure, and this raises the issue of unreliable constraints on UAVs in its composition. A standardized solution for the authentication of a single drone using the new 5G radio network (NR) is known, but for a swarm of drones, this is an open field of research. Per-UAV authentication key sharing as described in 5G NR does not scale across groups of UAVs. Objective. The purpose of this work is to conduct an analytical review and consider approaches to creating procedures for the authentication of a swarm of UAVs/drones with wireless equipment on board for the 5G NR network, taking into account the features of swarm formation and the very requirements for 5G authentication. Methods. Analysis of factors affecting the quality of provision of telecommunication services using UAVs in fifth generation networks. Analysis of well-known publications dedicated to the implementation of 5G networks and the use of drones in them. Comparing the implementation of UAV authentication procedures with on-board wireless equipment in the 5G network. Results. The widespread use of small UAVs, as well as the large expansion of wireless 5G networks, requires new security measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data. Identification and Authentication for a mobile operator's network using drones allows for secure communication between its main components. This makes it possible to recognize the very drones that participate in the formation of such a network. Drone authentication often protects the communication channel by preventing replay attacks. The development of drone radio access control mechanisms, such as authorization and authentication mechanisms, remain relevant researches for the construction of promising radio access networks involving UAVs. It has been confirmed that the introduction of special group procedures for the authentication of a swarm of drones in the 5G network can significantly improve the quality of the provision of telecommunication services. Conclusions. When working with a swarm of drones, in addition to the usual problems with encryption and authentication (within the swarm and for communication between the swarm and the ground control station), there are additional problems related to the constant change in the composition of the swarm and its hovering position: drones can join or leave a swarm. Depending on the swarm management structure, a different method of authentication will be needed, which makes it difficult to unify such procedures for a swarm of drones. Authentication procedures for a swarm of drones in 5G can be implemented through the following approaches: individual authentication, when each drone as a member of the swarm undergoes authentication with one NR 5G ground station"; you can consider such an approach as authentication of a group of IoT devices, if the traffic of the swarm is very limited; group authentication through a leader drone that communicates with swarm members and the 5G operator's network;" group distributed authentication through edge drones. Group authentication via a drone leader is presented, where authentication is performed through a mechanism based on distributed delegation to reduce the service traffic directed to the 5G operator's core network. Here, legitimate drones are authorized as proxy delegated signers to perform authentication on behalf of the underlying network. Group distributed authentication through boundary drones is considered, which offers more solutions than the case of authentication through a leader drone. Here, a solution is possible for several cases at once, for example, authentication of new drones (entering the swarm or leaving the swarm) and merging two separate drone swarms."",,,Information and Telecommunication Sciences,,,,2024-06-28,2024,2024-06-28,,,1,18-27,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Kravchuk, Serhii";" Kravchuk, Iryna"",""Kravchuk, Serhii (Educational and Research Institute of Telecommunication Systems of Igor Sikorsky Кyiv Polytechnic Institute, Кyiv, Ukraine)";" Kravchuk, Iryna (Educational and Research Institute of Telecommunication Systems of Igor Sikorsky Кyiv Polytechnic Institute, Кyiv, Ukraine)"",,""Kravchuk, Serhii (National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”)";" Kravchuk, Iryna (National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.20535/2411-2976.12024.18-27,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173518649,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The E-band is located in the frequency range from 60 to 90 GHz. The use of the E-band allows radio systems to approach data transmission over optical fiber in terms of connection speed [1]. An increase in the frequency of the operating range automatically leads to a decrease in the coverage area of one transmitter. The size of cells in 5G and 6G systems is already micro-cells and pico-cells, which sometimes provides coverage only in a certain building. Most of the models used to calculate radio routes located inside buildings are based on the formula describing the propagation of radio waves in free space. However, the presence of walls, floors, furniture, people and other objects significantly affects the nature of radio wave propagation. The variety of conditions leads to the necessity of using some empirical models based on numerous experiments to investigate the conditions of radio wave propagation indoors. In this work, it is proposed to take two models as a basis - an experimental one [3] and an analytical one taking into account the reverberation field [2]. The combination of the analytical and experimental model allows you to estimate both the line-of-sight channel and the channel without line-of-sight"; take into account the individual features of the premises, significantly reducing the error characteristic of experimental models;" Due to the use of the indicator of the degree of losses on the route according to the experimental model, it is possible to more accurately take into account the nature of the premises.

Therefore, the 5th generation mobile communication technology (5G) positioning is introduced to establish a hybrid positioning system of BDS pseudo-range combined with 5G time of arrival (TOA) and angle of arrival (AOA). The noise distribution of the observation data has strong randomness, which leads to the contamination of the update of the prior covariance matrix in the Kalman filter (KF) prediction step, and affects the optimal estimation of the UAV position. Therefore, an adaptive variational Bayesian (VB) localization algorithm is proposed. The algorithm first uses the least squares (LS) solution of the positioning observation as the observation input of the KF, and judges the distribution type of the original observation noise according to the Grubbs criterion. Then, the VB update factor of the covariance matrix is adaptively adjusted according to the Gaussian or heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise distribution to optimize the position estimation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high-precision positioning and anti-interference performance under different states of UAV, different degrees of satellite occlusion, and different probability of random interference."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

In this context, there is a significant opportunity to explore new market models for the management and utilization of the radio spectrum. Access to the radio spectrum results in diverse competition schemes, where market behavior varies based on the regulator-defined access scheme and the competitive strategies of different actors. To thoroughly analyze potential competition scenarios, this work introduces a model that enhances the comprehension of market variables, emphasizing behaviors influenced by relationships. The model’s development leverages the potential of artificial intelligence and historical data from Colombia’s mobile telecommunications market. Intelligent spectrum sensing, based on Software Defined Radio, augments the model’s construction, utilizing lightweight AI algorithms to acquire real data on spectrum occupancy. In this way, the model provides novel insights into market dynamics, enabling the formulation of informed decision-making policies for regulatory bodies. Additionally, the application of causal machine learning (CausalML) helps understand the underlying causes of market behaviors, facilitating the design of guiding policies to maximize spectrum usage and foster competition. This approach demonstrates how AI-driven approaches and a deeper understanding of market dynamics can lead to effective 5G spectrum management, fostering a more competitive and efficient wireless communication landscape."",The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude for the invaluable support received from the University of Antioquia and the Commission for Communications Regulation (CRC).,""This research was partially funded by the Colombian Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation (Minciencias) and the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC), under the contract CT 80740-035-2022.

We present methods for an SSCR that is spatially consistent, such that mobile transmitter and receiver cause a correlated time-varying channel impulse response and closely spaced antennas are correctly correlated. An SSCR is composed of a dynamically varying number of multipath components solely defined by the environment geometry and the material of the environmental objects. Hence, the environment geometry is the only natural scenario parameterization and specific calibration procedures shall be avoided. 5G and 6G physical layer technologies are increasingly able to exploit the properties of a wide range of environments from dense urban areas to railways, road transportation, industrial automation, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

As accurate site-specific radio propagation simulations are desired in these systems, it is important to create accurate propagation environment models from the viewpoint of radio propagation. In this paper, we propose the building material model for the radio propagation simulation. In our model, building materials are modeled by the multi-layer plates. The dielectric and geometric model parameters of each material layer are estimated from the free space measurement by the maximum likelihood-based algorithm. The experiment was conducted in the 33 GHz band in indoor environments for the investigation of millimeter-wave band radio propagation characteristics in Beyond 5G system, and the model parameters of the building materials were estimated by our proposed method. The results showed that wood and glass walls had significant frequency dependencies on the radio wave reflection characteristics, and the modeling accuracy was significantly improved by introducing our multi-layered building material model.

However, the 5G NTN serving a mobile device poses energy efficiency and short block-length support challenges. Given this, we propose a sphere-shaped polar coded PAS with path metric (PM) inheritance supported multi-level coding and multi-stage decoding (MLC-MSD) architecture. In the proposed design, a modified de-mapping and code construction approach addresses the inherent inaccuracy in Polar code construction for the most significant bit (MSB) level in the polar PAS scenario. It utilizes the widened inter-path PM gaps at MSB decoding to improve the average log-likelihood ratio (LLR) prediction as compared to the regular mutual information (MI) based calculation";" this improves the Gaussian approximation (GA) design. In addition, we propose a sphere-class aided polar decoding that utilizes the sphere-shaped symbol sequence energy pattern during the CRC-aided successive cancellation list decoding (CASCL). The frame error rate (FER) results show up to 1.4 dB gain as compared to the regular polar PAS architecture.

This system has kept evolving and deployed into a wireless system of Fifth Generation (5G). One of the significant factors of the 5G system has utilized Machine Learning (ML) as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the wireless network. Each of the building block and components of the wireless system, which is familiar and involves one or other ML/AI techniques are required. Here, the 5G generation has been used as the digital technology as well as run over higher radio frequencies. Further, the development of new techniques as well as the advanced features over the 5G network has raised some issues for the networking operators. ML is regarded as the AI that is accepted to unlock the capability of difficult large-scale issues over traditional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. Today’s wireless system has incomplete the MIMO system that has become common in recent years due to the increased potential in both energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency at a significant rate. AI-dependent ML has resolved the issues and then offers more energy efficiency and throughput in the 5G system. Hence, an effective artificial intelligence-based solution is introduced for resolving the aforementioned challenges to execute an efficient MIMO system in this proposal. In this work, the operations that are carried out for developing an efficient MIMO communication system are channel estimation, spectrum sensing of channels, fault/anomaly detection, resource allocation, and edge computation offloading. For performing all these functions, a deep learning method called Adaptive Autoencoder-Based Dilated DNN with Attention Mechanism (AADD-AM) is implemented. The parameters of the designed model are optimized with the help of Modified Update of Ant Lion and Horse herd Optimization (MU-ALHO) to achieve an accurate and effective outcome. The performance of the suggested efficient MIMO model is validated by comparing it with various performance metrics. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy and sensitivity rate of the designed model is 94.86% and 95.18%.

The process of getting the ball beyond the opponent’s net and landing on the court involves complex biomechanical actions such as jumping, spiking, and blocking. These actions require appropriate muscle activation, joint movement, and force generation.

These uncertainties not only brought great challenges to the manufacturing approaches led by a single enterprise, but also threatened the stability of inherent supply chain. To maintain market competitiveness, an efficient distributed manufacturing resource allocation method is urgently needed by manufacturers. Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is an advanced service-oriented manufacturing paradigm that breaks physical space constraints to integrate distributed resources across enterprises, and provides on-demand configuration of manufacturing services for personalized consumer needs in real-time. The focus of this paper is to achieve dynamic configuration of distributed resources in CMfg considering stochastic order arrival, while reducing overall completion time and improving resource utilization. First, a dynamic knowledge graph for distributed resources is constructed, and its definition and construction methods are introduced. Secondly, semantic matching between massive optional manufacturing resources and multiple types of subtasks is achieved through knowledge extraction, thereby obtaining a candidate set of manufacturing resources that meet basic requirements for each subtask. An artificial intelligence (AI) scheduler based on deep reinforcement learning is developed, and order urgency is incorporated into the design of state observation vectors. AI scheduler can generate optimal decision results based on environmental observations, select high-quality manufacturing service compositions over candidate sets, and ultimately achieve efficient distributed resources configuration. Finally, Dueling DQN-based training method is put forward to optimize AI scheduler, enabling adaptable decision-making performance in dynamic environment. In the experiment, a simulation environment with 18 different settings is designed that considers stochastic processing time, random order compositions and various order arrival patterns. The proposed graph-based matching method, scheduling policy learning method and dynamic decision-making method are tested in the simulation environment.

Allocations in the lower and upper mid-band aim to balance coverage and capacity, but there is limited knowledge about the radio propagation characteristics in the 4–24 GHz frequency bands. Here we present the world’s first comprehensive indoor propagation measurement and channel modeling study at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz in mid-band spectrum conducted at the NYU WIRELESS Research Center spanning distances from 11–97 m using 31 dBm EIRP transmit power with 15 and 20 dBi gain rotatable horn antennas at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, respectively. Analysis of the omnidirectional and directional propagation path loss using the close-in free space model with 1 m reference distance reveals a familiar waveguiding effect in indoor environments for line-of-sight (LOS). Compared to mmWave frequencies, the omnidirectional LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) path loss exponents (PLE) are similar, when using a close-in 1 m free space path loss reference distance model. Observations of the omnidirectional and directional RMS delay spread (DS) at FR1(C) and FR3 as compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies indicate decreasing RMS DS as the carrier frequency is increased. The RMS angular spreads (AS) at 6.75 GHz are found to be wider compared to 16.95 GHz, showing greater number of multipath components from a broader set of directions in the azimuthal spatial plane when compared to higher frequencies. This work also presents results from extensive material penetration loss measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using co and cross polarized antenna configurations for ten common construction materials found inside buildings and on building perimeters, including concrete walls, low-emissivity glass, wood, doors, drywall, and whiteboard. Our findings show penetration loss increases with frequency for all of the ten materials and partitions tested, and suggest further investigation of 3GPP material penetration loss models for at least infrared reflective (IRR) glass and concrete may be necessary. The empirical data and resulting models for radio propagation and penetration loss presented in this paper provide critical information for future 5G and 6G wireless communications."",Authors thank Profs.

To address the challenges of low-latency synchronization, high computational overhead, and multidimensional resource scheduling faced by the vehicle digital twin (VDT) construction process within IoVs, we propose a construction scheme for variable granularity VDT. First, a variable granularity VDT construction framework for IoVs is proposed to reduce the communication pressure, edge load, and energy consumption in the network. Second, the VDT utility is quantified from four dimensions: 1) completeness"; 2) accuracy; 3) timeliness;" and 4) energy efficiency. Then, an optimization model is established with the goal of maximizing the average utility of the system VDT, which involves joint optimization of vehicle-edge association, VDT granularity setting and resource allocation. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, it is decomposed into subproblems of vehicle-edge association, VDT granularity setting and resource allocation, and solved using matching theory and multiagent deep reinforcement learning, respectively. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the utility of VDT in different simulation scenarios while reducing system resource consumption."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62071078, and in part by the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2021YFQ0053."",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-08-21,2024-01-01,11,23,38469-38485,Closed,Article,""Tang, Lun"; Pu, Zhoulin; Cheng, Zhangchao; Fang, Dongxu;" Chen, Qianbin"",""Tang, Lun (School of Communications and Information Engineering, and the Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China)"; Pu, Zhoulin (School of Communications and Information Engineering, and the Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China); Cheng, Zhangchao (School of Communications and Information Engineering, and the Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China); Fang, Dongxu (Network Optimization Center, China Mobile Group Chongqing Company Ltd., Chongqing, 401121, China);" Chen, Qianbin (School of Communications and Information Engineering, and the Chongqing Key Laboratory of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, 400065, China)"",""Pu, Zhoulin (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Tang, Lun (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"; Pu, Zhoulin (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Cheng, Zhangchao (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Fang, Dongxu (Network Optimization Center, China Mobile Group Chongqing Company Ltd., Chongqing, 401121, China);" Chen, Qianbin (Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1174953648,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cellular networks, especially 5G cellular networks not only provide the key digital infrastructure for promoting the digital information world but also produce massive carbon emission when the energy consumption of 5G cellular networks is increased five to ten times compared with that of 4G. In the construction and maintenance of the next generation cellular networks, it is an inevitable challenge to reduce energy consumption and carbon emission of communication devices, such as base stations, switches and servers. In this article, we first determine terminologies and definitions for carbon emission and carbon efficiency of mobile communication systems. In particular, the carbon emission of current mobile communication systems, as well as the relationship between carbon efficiency, energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency, is elaborated. To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, we propose a four-layer network architecture assisted by an overall carbon neutral network management module.

Such an aim is even more complex in the next generation wireless systems (6G) where wireless connectivity is expected to serve any connected intelligent unit, such as software robots and humans interacting in the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, drones, trains, or smart sensors monitoring cities, buildings, and the environment. Because of the wireless devices will be orders of magnitude denser than in 5G cellular systems, and because of their complex quality of service requirements, the access to the wireless spectrum will have to be appropriately shared to avoid congestion, poor quality of service, or unsatisfactory communication delays. Spectrum sharing methods have been the objective of intense study through model-based approaches, such as optimization or game theories. However, these methods may fail when facing the complexity of the communication environments in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application and development of data-driven methods, namely machine learning methods, to handle the complex operation of spectrum sharing. In this survey, we provide a complete overview of the state-of-theart of machine learning for spectrum sharing. First, we map the most prominent methods that we encounter in spectrum sharing. Then, we show how these machine learning methods are applied to the numerous dimensions and sub-problems of spectrum sharing, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum access, and spectrum handoff.

However, these storage resources often remain idle, leading to inefficiency. To enhance the utilization of base station energy storage (BSES), this paper proposes a co-regulation method for distribution network (DN) voltage control, enabling BSES participation in grid interactions. In this paper, firstly, an energy consumption prediction model based on long and short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is established to accurately predict the daily load changes of base stations. Secondly, a BSES aggregation model is constructed by using the power feasible domain maximal inner approximation method and Minkowski summation to evaluate the charging and discharging potential and adjustable capacity of BSES clusters. Subsequently, a BSES demand assessment and optimal scheduling model for low voltage regulation in DN is developed. This model optimizes the charging and discharging strategies of BSES to alleviate low voltage problems in DN.

With the arrival of the 5G era, more SAW devices with more complicated structures such as bonding wafers need to be integrated, easily leading to heat accumulation, so investigating heat dissipation in SAW devices is now necessary and urgent. Learning from the thermal-management researches in other fields and considering the mechanism and properties of SAW devices, this work believes that optimizing material design is efficient for heat dissipation enhancement. Therefore, this work for the first time systematically investigates the impacts of material design on heat dissipation and power handling which is significantly influenced by heat dissipation, building up a thermal-management theory for SAW devices based on bonding wafers. This work proposes a theoretical thermal calculation method for SAW devices, building a model and coding a calculation program. This work develops an experimental method by which the impacts of material design on heat dissipation can be deduced from those on power handling, designing and fabricating band-8 duplexers based on bonding wafers with different material designs. This work reveals that SiO2 and epoxy both weaken heat dissipation and impair power handling, while Si, sapphire, and SiC can all be chosen as heat-sink materials.

"581,pub.1169220018,10.1155/2024/9062023,,,A Deep‐Learning Approach to a Volumetric Radio Environment Map Construction for UAV‐Assisted Networks,""Providing global coverage for ubiquitous users is a key requirement of the fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless technologies. This can be achieved by integrating airborne networks, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite networks, with terrestrial networks. However, the deployment of airborne networks in a three-dimensional (3D) or volumetric space requires a new understanding of the propagation channel and its losses in both the areal and altitude dimensions. Despite significant research on radio environment map (REM) construction, much of it has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) contexts. This neglects the altitude-related characteristics of electromagnetic wave propagation and confines REMs to 2D formats, which limits the comprehensive and continuous visualization of propagation environment variation in spatial dimensions. This paper proposes a volumetric REM (VREM) construction approach to compute 3D propagation losses. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of existing approaches by learning the spatial correlation of wireless propagation channel characteristics and visualizing REM in areal and height/altitude dimensions using deep learning models. Specifically, the approach uses two deep learning-based models: volume-to-volume (Vol2Vol) VREM with 3D-generative adversarial networks and sliced VREM with altitude-aware spider-UNets. In both cases, knowledge of the propagation environment and transmitter locations in 3D space is used to capture the spatial and altitude dependency of the propagation channel’s characteristics. We developed the Addis dataset, a large REM dataset comprising 54,000 samples collected from the urban part of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to train the proposed models. Each sample of data comprises a 512-meter by 512-meter areal resolution with different 3D obstacles (buildings and terrain), 15 simulated propagation loss maps at every 3-meter altitude resolution, and 80 different 3D transmitter locations. The results of the training and testing of the proposed models reveal that the constructed VREMs are statistically comparable. In particular, the Vol2Vol approach has a minimum L1 loss of 0.01, which further decreases to 0.0084 as the line-of-sight (LoS) probability increases to 0.95."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

With a wider coverage, more people and devices will access the 5G network, allowing them to experience the benefits and capabilities of this important technology. However, the development and construction of the networks need a lot of time and effort to maximize network coverage and service delivery while utilizing the fewest possible infrastructure components. Path loss models are commonly employed to predict network coverage. Therefore, it is expedient to adopt a path loss model that is suitable for the specified geographical area. In this paper, we investigated and analysed two empirical models: the Close-in free space reference distance (CI) model and the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model at the low- and mid-spectrum bands. Secondly, the path loss parameters were derived to characterize the two empirical models based on data from the measurement campaign. Finally, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was employed for the comparison of the models. It was found that at frequencies 0.9 and 1.8 GHz, the CI model's least RMSE values were 3.6 and 4.1 at location 1 and 4.7 and 4.2 dB at location 2, respectively, outperforming the ABG. However, at 3.4 GHz, the ABG with 3.25 and 1.75 dB outperformed the CI at both locations. For future work, the integration of machine learning techniques to dynamically predict and adapt path loss models in real time based on continuous data collection will be appropriate."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A Rogers RT5880 substrate material is used in the construction of the proposed MIMO antenna. This substrate material has dimensions of 0.064 λ × 0.012 λ (at 24 GHz), a thickness of 0.8 mm, and a dielectric constant of 2.2.The results of the testing suggest that the antenna has the potential to span a frequency range that stretches from 23.5 to 25.5 GHz (6.1%) and from 34.2 to 36.4 (8.2%) GHz. In addition, the antenna does not need the usage of a sophisticated decoupling structure in order to achieve an inter-port isolation of higher than 15 dB between the antenna components across both bands. This is possible since the antenna is dual-banded. The results that were obtained from the measurement of the antenna after it was put through its paces are as follows. The components that make up this diagram are merged together to form a single entity. An envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0.005 and a channel capacity loss of less than 0.315 bits/s/Hz are the results of analysing the diversity performance characteristics. These results are totally compatible with the criteria and norms that are taken into consideration to be acceptable as a whole.

To meet these demands sustainably, it is critical to enhance energy efficiency, resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness while reducing the carbon footprint. Simply adding hardware is not a viable solution. This study introduces an innovative approach to 3D cellular deployment in sustainable B5G/6G networks, designed to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) for users and IoT devices. Although 5G/B5G utilizes millimeter waves for high data rate transmission, their limited coverage and susceptibility to interference from buildings pose unique deployment challenges. To address these, we formulate the 3D cellular deployment problem as a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem and propose an advanced deployment strategy using VA-NSGA-II, a metaheuristic-based algorithm. By factoring in building interference, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), coverage, deployment cost, and a balance between performance and sustainability, VA-NSGA-II provides an optimal deployment solution. Simulation results demonstrate that VA-NSGA-II achieves effective deployment performance across various building materials, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness in different environmental scenarios."",,,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,,,,2025-02-26,2025,2025-02-26,,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,""Chien, Wei-Che"; Jeon, Gwanggil;" Cho, Hsin-Hung"",""Chien, Wei-Che (Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan)"; Jeon, Gwanggil (Department of Embedded Systems Engineering Incheon National University Incheon, Republic of Korea);" Cho, Hsin-Hung (Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Ilan University, YiLan, Taiwan)"",,""Chien, Wei-Che (National Dong Hwa University)"; Jeon, Gwanggil (Incheon National University);" Cho, Hsin-Hung (National Ilan University)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1185964764,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, indoor SBS is constrained by factors such as service capacity, signal interference, and structural layout. Merchants within large buildings frequently host diverse activities to attract visitors, significantly increasing indoor traffic and crowd-gathering phenomenon. Consequently, SBS faces challenges of excessive energy consumption, compromised communication quality, and an inability to provide service to all visitors. Merchants aim to deploy SBS that can effectively curtail energy consumption costs while fulfilling visitor needs. However, due to the intermittent nature of high footfall situations, employing additional fixed SBS is not economically viable. Therefore, we address the challenge of maintaining service quality and mitigating energy consumption of SBS during footfall fluctuations by proposing an SBS model with a dynamic sleep mechanism. We simulate the internal structure of a three-dimensional (3D) building and the footfall over time. Within this model, we leverage the flexibility of mobile small-cell base stations (MSBS) to seamlessly traverse service regions. We compute the transmission power and location of SBS and MSBS based on energy efficiency (EE), combining their strengths to tackle the challenge. This approach maintains SBS communication quality while curbing energy consumption. We attain the optimal hybrid deployment strategy by enhancing the adaptive differential evolution with optional external archive (JADE) algorithm and incorporating the final fitness formula, the adaptive ranking mutation operator strategy, and the disorder replacement strategy (DRS) in it to form the proposed joint adaptive fusion with ranking (JAFR) algorithm. Our comparative simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JAFR in addressing the challenges against conventional methods, recent differential evolution algorithms, and mobile base station (MBS) deployment approaches posed by this model. The results indicate that the JAFR algorithm yields superior SBS deployment strategies in most cases."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Hongwei Kang reports financial support was provided by Yunnan University.

The geopolymers had good dielectric properties with a low dielectric constant and increased dielectric loss and loss tangent, subsequently contributing to the microwave absorption properties. The microwave absorption ability increased from 60.0% to >80.0% at an optimal thickness of 100.0 mm and antenna separation of 20.0 mm. The presence of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C–S–H) refined the microstructure and enhanced the microwave absorption performance.

However, the long and closed spaces, irregular surfaces, and variable topology as tunnel excavation impose rigorous limitations on signal propagation, communication quality and coverage. To alleviate the realistic issues, we introduce a holistic three-phase cooperative relay scheme based on 5G New Radio (NR) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) architecture, which can extend the communication range and enhance network throughput. We theoretically derive the outage probability of the entire cooperative relaying process from source to destination, and quantify the impact of relaying on construction workflow with relay cost. To minimize the outage probability and relay cost, we formulate a cooperative relay strategies optimization problem and transform the solving procedure into a Markov decision process (MDP). We design a hybrid hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HH-PPO) reinforcement learning method to solve the MDP, which consists of two discrete actor networks, two continuous actor networks, and two critic networks. The hybrid structure enables HH-PPO to tackle the mixed action space, and the hierarchical structure enables adaptive and contextual actions generation by integrating the discrete network outputs into the continuous actor network. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the HH-PPO algorithm with faster convergence speed, and show superior performance in terms of lower, stable outage probability and relay cost satisfaction compared with another benchmark."",,,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2024-11-28,2024,2024-11-28,,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,""Ning, Pengfei"; Wang, Hongwei; Tang, Tao; Zhang, Jie; Chen, Changji; Niyato, Dusit;" Yu, F.

However, these systems often lead to problems such as messy airflow, hot spots, and excessive energy consumption. With the rapid development of 5G technology, the integration and power density of communication equipment continue to increase, exacerbating these problems. To address these issues, a micro-environment strategy has been developed. This strategy combines cabinet-level airflow components with unique multi-adjustable-vent air conditioners(MAVACs), which are suitable for the co-deployment of various high power density communication equipment with different airflow patterns in TBSs. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the cooling performance of the proposed MAVAC, and CFD simulation was carried out to investigate the temperature distribution and airflow patterns using a typical TBS in China that has implemented the micro-environment strategy. The results demonstrate that the micro-environment strategy effectively separates the cold air and hot air, preventing the occurrence of hot spots. The maximum return air temperature of MAVACs was found to be 38.6℃.

Therefore, analyzing attackers’ intrusion intentions and penetration behaviors is crucial for guiding network security defenses. However, existing penetration path constructions mostly rely on a single agent or consider a single type of network, which cannot comprehensively assess the impact of group attack behaviors and system vulnerability combinations on security. To address this issue, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is presented for collaborative path penetration. This solution leverages network situational information to guide policy learning, improving the overall path penetration quality. Agents adopt a hierarchical structure of primary and subordinate roles. The primary agent can observe the entire environmental state and formulate top-level collaborative strategies for the group, while subordinate agents learn individual policies based on assigned tasks and team rewards and interact with the environment to learn. Through this mode, agents coordinate with each other to select and continuously improve their strategies in penetration. Experimental results show that compared with single-path penetration under a single agent, the proposed method generates multiple penetration paths with higher attack efficiency, decision stability, and task completion rate."",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial assistance provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province.,""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61502230 and 61501224, the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20201357, and the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province under Grant RJFW-020."",Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications,,,,2025-03-04,2025,2025-03-04,2025-06,18,3,113,Closed,Article,""Shen, Hang"; Li, Xiang; Wang, Yan; Wang, Tianjing;" Bai, Guangwei"",""Shen, Hang (College of Computer and Information Engineering (College of Artificial Intelligence), Nanjing Tech University, 211816, Nanjing, China)"; Li, Xiang (College of Computer and Information Engineering (College of Artificial Intelligence), Nanjing Tech University, 211816, Nanjing, China); Wang, Yan (College of Computer and Information Engineering (College of Artificial Intelligence), Nanjing Tech University, 211816, Nanjing, China); Wang, Tianjing (College of Computer and Information Engineering (College of Artificial Intelligence), Nanjing Tech University, 211816, Nanjing, China);" Bai, Guangwei (College of Computer and Information Engineering (College of Artificial Intelligence), Nanjing Tech University, 211816, Nanjing, China)"",""Wang, Tianjing (Nanjing Tech University)"",""Shen, Hang (Nanjing Tech University)"; Li, Xiang (Nanjing Tech University); Wang, Yan (Nanjing Tech University); Wang, Tianjing (Nanjing Tech University);" Bai, Guangwei (Nanjing Tech University)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1186196688,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its success hinges on the realization of infrastructures for air traffic control and management (ATM) to guarantee security and safety in mobility scenarios including thousands of flying drones and aircraft operating at low heights and crossing paths while adhering to designated clearance zones around buildings. For the ATM system to effectively manage and control air traffic, real time tracking of the positions of flying objects is essential. This paper aims to propose and discuss the architecture key functionalities of a dedicated communication system designed for periodic transmission of position messages from drones and aircraft to the ATM. This system leverages on synchronous 5G technology, utilizing negative numerology to enable very narrow-band transmissions. The paper analyzes the main challenges associated with the planning of this system including its capacity to serve a specific number of drones and aircraft for fixed allocated bandwidth. It is shown that, depending on the achievable minimum modulation and coding scheme in the flying area, the system can serve thousands of drones/aircraft per assigned bandwidth of 20 MHz. Additionally, we discuss a scheme for the OFDMA receiver at the radio unit (RU) able to estimate and compensate for frequency differences among drones/aircraft signals received at the same RU.

Gradually, the form design of simple single-patch MIMO antennas gives way to four-element MIMO antennas. Four microstrip antennas are integrated using button-like circular caps on the main patches. Reduced ground is also used in the construction of many band characteristics. Excellent isolation can be achieved by using Rectangular Metallic Strip (RMS). The suggested MIMO antenna has the advantage of covering two significant frequency bands. At 3.07 GHz and 6.31 GHz, the antenna system resonates with a total bandwidth of 2.43 GHz. The antenna design uses a FR4 substrate measuring 35 mm by 49 mm by 1.6 mm in thickness. For simulation purposes, Teflon and a specially made SMA connector with a perfect electrical conductor (PEC) are used to enhance impedance matching. An 8.2 mm feed line with an inset feed is also utilized. Research and investigation are conducted on radiation properties, including mean effective gain, envelope correction coefficient, reflection coefficient, and more.

The antenna has an SIW construction with a three-sided short circuit and a one-sided open circuit, with the ferrite material inserted into the substrate. The frequency reconfiguration is accomplished by altering the bias magnetic field. The simulation results reveal that the tunable frequency range is more than 5.2 (from 5.26 GHz to 5.54 GHz) for the lower bias magnetic field and 7.1 (from 4.64 GHz to 4.98 GHz) for the higher bias magnetic field.

However, current workpiece postures still rely on manual judgments based on workers' experience, which has become one of major issues hindering the further advancement of intelligent welding systems towards mass production. To cope with this issue, aiming at four typical regular butt joints, a systematic tackling framework is proposed and carried out from posture description, posture feature construction, posture metrics to visualization model reconstruction. At a core, the prototype feature is proposed to characterize pre-welding workpiece postures and a series of text characters based on it is introduced to describe various anomalous workpiece postures including concurrent tilt, misalignment, seam variation, and stacking between them. A comprehensive process for constructing prototype features is performed from data acquisition, image processing to key point search, among which the algorithms for extracting differential features of different seam types are integrated. Based on the constructed prototype features, several posture metric parameters are defined, and workpiece posture models can be easily reconstructed. In addition, the good generalizability of the proposed framework for seam types with regular edge and seam features is also discussed. Ultimately, experimental results show that the prototype feature-based posture description of the pre-welding workpiece can efficiently and accurately characterize multiple anomalous postures."",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The proposed FSS based on cross-dipole unit is designed with a cascading structure on a PET layer, which allows to achieve bandpass filter in electromagnetic wave incidents range from 0° ~ 45° in the n257 and n258 bands (24.25 to 29.5 GHz). Furthermore, the proposed FSSs on window glass is cheap and universally applicable to building window by using commercial glass as a substrate for FSS while aesthetically transparent. Therefore, trade-off relationship between the area of the FSS and optical transparency is analyzed.

However, shared resources among multiple D2D user pairs can result in significant interference. In advanced 5G networks and beyond, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology for reducing power consumption in cloud data centers while ensuring reliability and real-time access for end devices. Nonetheless, the inherent complexity and variability of MEC networks present significant challenges in task offloading ( $T_{o}$ ) solutions. This study introduces an optimized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for D2D-assisted task offloading ( $T_{o}$ ) and resource allocation ( $R_{a}$ ) to address these challenges. The process begins with the construction of the MEC network scenario, followed by the implementation of a human evolutionary optimization-aided DRL ( $HEOp-DRL$ ) model to handle task offloading and resource allocation tasks jointly. The HEOp method minimizes time and power consumption constraints while efficiently allocating resources across end devices. The proposed DRL model uses the Markov decision process (MDP) to facilitate collaborative task offloading between end devices and MEC servers, deriving an optimal policy for offloading and resource allocation. The system is simulated on the MATLAB platform, and key performance metrics such as latency, average energy consumption, and sum rate (SR) are analyzed and compared with those of existing methods. The results demonstrate enhanced robustness in addressing resource allocation and task offloading challenges in D2D-MEC systems, with a minimized overall latency, and less energy consumption."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2025-01-01,2025,2025-01-23,2025-01-01,13,,19420-19437,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Gottam, Sambi Reddy";" Kar, Udit Narayana"",""Gottam, Sambi Reddy (School of Computer Science and Engineering, VIT-AP University, Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, 522237, India)";" Kar, Udit Narayana (School of Computer Science and Engineering, VIT-AP University, Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh, 522237, India)"",""Kar, Udit Narayana (VIT-AP University)"",""Gottam, Sambi Reddy (VIT-AP University)";" Kar, Udit Narayana (VIT-AP University)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2025.3533034,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1184829167,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Accordingly, for the received power characteristics, the difference between the simulation value, which was based on the ray tracing method, and the experimental value at 32 points in the area was within a maximum difference of approximately 10 dB, and sufficient compliance was obtained. Regarding the transmission throughput versus received power characteristics, after showing a simulation method for evaluating throughput characteristics in MIMO, we compared the results with experimental results. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the transmission throughput shows that, at a CDF of 50%, in SISO transmission, the simulated value is approximately 115Mbps, and the experimental value is 105Mbps, within a difference of approximately 10Mbps. By contrast, in MIMO transmission, the simulation value is 380Mbps, and the experimental value is approximately 420Mbps, which is a difference of approximately 40Mbps.

"518,pub.1182682632,10.1145/3696399,,,Helix: A RAN Slicing Based Scheduling Framework for Massive MIMO Networks,""An important aspect of 5G networks is the development of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing, a concept wherein the virtualized infrastructure of wireless networks is subdivided into slices (or enterprises), tailored to fulfill specific use-cases. A key focus in this context is the efficient radio resource allocation to meet various enterprises' service-level agreements (SLAs). In this work, we introduce Helix: a channel-aware and SLA-aware RAN slicing framework for massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) networks where resource allocation extends to incorporate the spatial dimension available through beamforming. Essentially, the same time-frequency resource block (RB) can be shared across multiple users through multiple antennas. Notably, certain enterprises, particularly those operating critical infrastructure, necessitate dedicated RB allocation, denoted as private networks, to ensure security. Conversely, some enterprises would allow resource sharing with others in the public network to maintain network performance while minimizing capital expenditure. Building upon this understanding, Helix comprises scheduling schemes under both scenarios: where different slices share the same set of RBs, and where they require exclusivity of allocated RBs. We validate the efficacy of our proposed schedulers through simulation by utilizing a channel data set collected from a real-world massive MIMO testbed. Our assessments demonstrate that resource sharing across slices using our approach can lead up to 60.9% reduction in RB usage compared to other approaches. Moreover, our proposed schedulers exhibit significantly enhanced operational efficiency, with significantly faster running time compared to exhaustive greedy approaches while meeting the stringent 5G sub-millisecond-level latency requirement."",,,Proceedings of the ACM on Networking,,,,2024-11-25,2024,2024-11-25,2024-12,2,CoNEXT4,1-22,Closed,Article,""An, Qing"; Pandey, Divyanshu; Doost-Mohammady, Rahman; Sabharwal, Ashutosh;" Shakkottai, Srinivas"",""An, Qing (Rice University, Houston, USA)"; Pandey, Divyanshu (Rice University, Houston, USA); Doost-Mohammady, Rahman (Rice University, Houston, USA); Sabharwal, Ashutosh (Rice University, Houston, USA);" Shakkottai, Srinivas (Texas A&M University, College Station, USA)"",,""An, Qing (Rice University)"; Pandey, Divyanshu (Rice University); Doost-Mohammady, Rahman (Rice University); Sabharwal, Ashutosh (Rice University);" Shakkottai, Srinivas (Texas A&M University)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1182682632,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this article, we develop neural network-based positioning models with time- and frequency-domain channel state information (CSI) data in harsh non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. We propose a novel frequency-domain feature extraction, which combines relative phase differences and received powers across resource blocks, and offers robust performance and reliability. Additionally, we exploit the multipath components and propose an aggregate time-domain feature combining time-of-flight, angle-of-arrival and received path-wise powers. Importantly, the temporal correlations are also harnessed in the form of sequence processing neural networks, which prove to be of particular benefit for vehicular UEs. Realistic numerical evaluations in large-scale line-of-sight (LoS)-obstructed urban environment with moving vehicles are provided, building on full ray-tracing based propagation modeling. The results show the robustness of the proposed CSI features in terms of positioning accuracy, and that the proposed models reliably localize UEs even in the absence of a LoS path, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art with similar or even reduced processing complexity. The proposed sequence-based neural network model is capable of tracking the UE position, speed and heading simultaneously despite the strong uncertainties in the CSI measurements. Finally, it is shown that differences between the training and online inference environments can be efficiently addressed and alleviated through transfer learning."",,""This work was supported by the Academy of Finland under Grant #319994, Grant #323244, Grant #328214, Grant #338224 and Grant #357730.

In this paper, we first prove the maximum likelihood (ML) performance approaches MWUB as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity and provide the deviation when MWD and SNR are given. Then, we propose a nested reliability sequence, namely MWD sequence, to construct polar codes independently of channel information. In the sequence, synthetic channels are sorted by partial MWD which is used to evaluate the influence of information bit on MWD and we prove the MWD sequence is the optimum sequence evaluated by MWUB for polar codes obeying partial order. Finally, we introduce an entropy constraint to establish a relationship between list size and MWUB and propose a heuristic construction method named entropy constraint bit-swapping (ECBS) algorithm, where we initialize information set by the MWD sequence and gradually swap information bit and frozen bit to satisfy the entropy constraint. The simulation results show the MWD sequence is more suitable for constructing polar codes with short code length than the polar sequence in 5G and the ECBS algorithm can improve MWD to show better performance as list size increases."",,,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2024-09-11,2024,2024-09-11,,PP,99,1-1,All OA";" Green,Article,""Piao, Jinnan"; Li, Dong; Liu, Jindi; Yu, Xueting; Li, Zhibo; Yang, Ming;" Zeng, Peng"",""Piao, Jinnan (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China)"; Li, Dong (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China); Liu, Jindi (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China); Yu, Xueting (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China); Li, Zhibo (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China); Yang, Ming (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China);" Zeng, Peng (Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang, China)"",,""Piao, Jinnan (Shenyang Institute of Automation)"; Li, Dong (Shenyang Institute of Automation); Liu, Jindi (Shenyang Institute of Automation); Yu, Xueting (Shenyang Institute of Automation); Li, Zhibo (Shenyang Institute of Automation); Yang, Ming (Shenyang Institute of Automation);" Zeng, Peng (Shenyang Institute of Automation)"",0,0,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13019,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175663140,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conventional electrical grids often leave consumers unaware of their energy usage patterns, resulting in both energy wastage and financial loss. To enhance energy efficiency, the consumption patterns of consumers need regulation. Smart Grids efficiently employs Demand-Side Management (DSM) strategies, including peak clipping, load shifting, and consumer awareness campaigns, to optimize energy consumption and achieve energy savings. DSM’s synergy with smart meters and smart energy management systems (SEMS) emerges as a powerful trio in comprehensive energy conservation and optimization. The integration of SEMS with the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented by the advancements in 5G technology, emerges as a transformative paradigm. SEMS, operating within the IoT ecosystem bolstered by 5G connectivity, facilitates the instantaneous and efficient integration of IoT in SEMS, enabling real-time data collection, in-depth analysis, and data-driven decisions for optimal energy management. This empowers users with the ability to make data-driven decisions, yielding tangible outcomes in the form of efficacy, cost reductions, and fortified sustainability initiatives. We present a SEMS that amalgamates three microcontroller units to create a smart meter that is further integrated with a cloud-based middleware module and consumer API. Furthermore, it collects vital power metrics such as voltage, current, kWh, kW, and PF. Consumers can conveniently access this data in real-time via an API. Energy service companies can leverage this data for incentive programs and to motivate customers to optimize their energy consumption. These datasets serve as a foundational element for the development of diverse DSM strategies. This research work presents the deployment, and performance evaluation of an IoT-based SEMS that is implemented in diverse settings, including industrial, commercial, building, and warehouse setups. Moreover, as a test case, our evaluation extends to the specific conservation of energy within air-conditioning systems. The SEMS achieves significant energy conservation, with calculated savings ranging from 5% to 53%, showcasing its effectiveness in targeted energy management.

Open access to hardware and software tools is a focal point for advancing learning. In sciences, lab-based experiments constitute a vital part of curricula that bridge the gap between theory and practice. Access to remote lab tools is possible by pairing simulators, emulators and actual equipment, located in various geographical locations. Under this premise, Education 4.0 defines a new learning framework aligned with the fourth industrial revolution digital requirements. These constitute smart sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. In this context, University graduates need to prepare themselves with complex problem solving and interdisciplinary problems. To this end, contemporary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teaching practices should be present along the way. Digitally competent students need to learn from a modern and adjustable curriculum tailored to cover necessary skills related to Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, the digitization of University campuses, including smart IoT, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Fifth Generation (5G) automation infrastructures is necessary. In this work, we carry out an extensive STEM oriented survey which highlights and categorizes all contemporary digital tools and technologies needed to support future graduates.

For high-volume, millimeter-wave integrated circuits, operating roughly between 30 GHz and 300 GHz, testability is a major concern, both from an overall cost as well as a quality assurance perspective. A solution for cost effective, low-overhead test of millimeter-wave integrated circuits is the integration of built-in self-test (BIST) features into the high-frequency front-end. Because BIST is an emerging topic in high-frequency circuit design, the field is still very fragmented.

Especially in the jacking construction in complex strata, if the jacking parameters and lubrication grouting parameters cannot be adjusted in real time according to the circumferential pressure, it is easy to cause pipe sticking accident. Based on the Inner Mongolia Water Diversion Project from ChaorHe to Liaoning, this paper adopts the LPWA low‐power wide‐area network wireless sensing system based on 5G and IOT technology to realize the real‐time wireless monitoring of the contact pressure and lubrication grouting pressure of the underground pipe jacking pipe. Through the parameters obtained by the wireless sensing system, the stress characteristics of a specific pipe traversing different strata and under different working conditions were studied, and the change rule of circumferential contact pressure of the pipe and the influence of various factors on it were analyzed. The results show that: by analyzing the circumferential contact pressure obtained by the wireless sensing system, the pressure distribution of the pipe in the top soft and bottom hard strata is right>left>bottom>top"; in the full‐section strata, the destruction of the lubricating mud sleeve will lead to the same contact pressure on one side and the bottom of the pipe;" when the pipe traverse the interfaces of different rock strata, the stability of the lubricating mud sleeve will be affected, and thus the circumferential contact pressure will be altered. The above results are consistent with the theoretical prediction and can provide reference for the actual project. In conclusion, the wireless sensing system can accurately reflect the distribution of circumferential contact pressure of the pipe under different strata, and provide reliable data support for improving construction efficiency and safety."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.,Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work.,Engineering Reports,,,,2024-12-04,2024,2024-12-04,2025-01,7,1,,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Zhao, Yunfei"; Luo, Feilun;" Xiong, Liang"",""Zhao, Yunfei (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China)"; Luo, Feilun (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China);" Xiong, Liang (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China)"",""Zhao, Yunfei (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China)"",""Zhao, Yunfei (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China)"; Luo, Feilun (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China);" Xiong, Liang (Sinohydro Fifth Engineering Bureau co, Chengdu, China)"",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eng2.13066,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1183016402,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering; 4019 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These high-frequency bands are sensible to reflections and diffraction. Therefore, accurate path loss calculation relies on advanced models and ray tracing. However, this is time-consuming, and evaluating a large set of candidate solutions is no longer possible when planning the optimal number and location of base stations in the network planning process. This paper investigates the use of machine learning to approximate a complex mmWave ray-tracing-based path loss model in indoor scenarios. The much lower calculation time allows us to approximate the ray-tracer path loss estimation well and to apply a genetic algorithm for realizing network planning. The machine learning model is trained and validated for two buildings and tested with another, with an average of the Mean Absolute Error of 2.8 dB over all cases. It is shown that the combination of Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithm is able to find a network deployment in the FR2 band accounting for the minimum number of access points and minimum electromagnetic exposure, while still providing a predefined coverage percentage inside the building."",,""This work was supported in part by the Special Research Fund (BOF-Dutch Abbreviations), Belgium, under Grant 01W00818, and in part by the LACETEL, Cuba."",IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-05-27,2024-01-01,5,,3451-3467,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Santana, Yosvany Hervis"; Alonso, Rodney Martinez; Nieto, Glauco Guillen; Martens, Luc; Joseph, Wout;" Plets, David"",""Santana, Yosvany Hervis (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium"; Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, LACETEL, Havana, 19210, Cuba); Alonso, Rodney Martinez (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, 3000, Leuven, Belgium); Nieto, Glauco Guillen (Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, LACETEL, Havana, 19210, Cuba); Martens, Luc (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium); Joseph, Wout (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium);" Plets, David (Department of Information Technology, IMEC, Ghent University, 9052, Ghent, Belgium)"",""Santana, Yosvany Hervis (Ghent University";" Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, LACETEL, Havana, 19210, Cuba)"",""Santana, Yosvany Hervis (Ghent University"; Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, LACETEL, Havana, 19210, Cuba); Alonso, Rodney Martinez (Ghent University; KU Leuven); Nieto, Glauco Guillen (Research and Development Telecommunications Institute, LACETEL, Havana, 19210, Cuba); Martens, Luc (Ghent University); Joseph, Wout (Ghent University);" Plets, David (Ghent University)"",2,2,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8782661/8901158/10539184.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172118464,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A complex 3D ray tracing method carefully figures out the propagation paths using the geometry of a 3D environment and looks at the effects in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. The analysis considers critical parameters such as path loss, received power, weather loss, foliage loss, and the impact of varying UAV heights. Based on the analysis and regression modeling techniques, quadratic polynomials were found to accurately model the signal behavior, enabling signal strength predictions as a function of distances between the user and an elevated drone. Results were analyzed and compared with suburban areas with no mountains but more compact buildings surrounding the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) campus. The findings highlight the need to identify the optimal height for the UAV as a base station, characterize radio channels accurately, and predict coverage to optimize network design and deployment with UAVs as additional sources. The research offers valuable insights for optimizing signal transmission and network planning and resolving spectrum-management difficulties in mountainous areas to enhance wireless communication system performance. The study emphasizes the significance of visualizations, statistical analysis, and outlier detection for understanding signal behavior in diverse environments."",,This research was funded by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education National Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2021/ICT09/UKM/02/1) and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) (FA2386-21-1-4073).,Drones,,,,2024-07-19,2024,2024-07-19,,8,7,334,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Ali, Shujat"; Abu-Samah, Asma; Abdullah, Nor Fadzilah;" Kamal, Nadhiya Liyana Mohd"",""Ali, Shujat (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia";, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);, fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.)); Abu-Samah, Asma (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia;, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);, fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.)); Abdullah, Nor Fadzilah (Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia;, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);, fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.)); Kamal, Nadhiya Liyana Mohd (Unmanned Aerial System Research Laboratory, Malaysian Institute of Aviation Technology, Universiti Kuala Lumpur, Dengkil 43900, Selangor, Malaysia;", nadhiyaliyanamk@unikl.edu.my)"",""Abu-Samah, Asma (National University of Malaysia"; Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia;, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);", fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.))"",""Ali, Shujat (National University of Malaysia"; Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia;, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);, fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.)); Abu-Samah, Asma (National University of Malaysia; Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia;, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);, fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.)); Abdullah, Nor Fadzilah (National University of Malaysia; Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia;, p119165@siswa.ukm.edu.my, (S.A.);, fadzilah.abdullah@ukm.edu.my, (N.F.A.));" Kamal, Nadhiya Liyana Mohd (University of Kuala Lumpur)"",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/drones8070334,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173990599,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The designed flexible frequency reconfigurable antenna is a uniplanar construction that consists of two radiator strips and a ground plane. The strips and the ground are glued on a flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrate having a dielectric permittivity of 2.7 and thickness of 1 mm. An asymmetric coplanar strip feed is incorporated in the proposed uniplanar design to ​reduce the antenna size significantly. A parametric analysis is conducted to find the best suitable ground and radiator dimensions. The​ antenna is compact and its ​overall dimension is 23 mm x 10 mm x 1 mm. An ideal switch (copper strip) is inserted between the two radiating strips to enable reconfiguration in frequency by changing the radiators’ electrical path. During the ​OFF state of the switch, the antenna radiates from 4.6 GHz to 5.47 GHz whereas it radiates from 3.6 GHz to 4 GHz and 5.72 GHz to 6.3 GHz when the switch is ON. To validate the feasibility of the antenna for wearable applications, off-body, and on-body (Left-hand model) studies are given. The various performance parameters such as reflection coefficient, gain, radiation, and specific absorption rate show satisfactory/acceptable results. A maximum gain of 3.3 dB is noticed at 5.96 GHz during on-body testing. The observed minimum and ​maximum specific absorption rate values are 1.21 W/kg and 1.56 W/kg averaged over 1 gram of tissue ​which ​falls within the limit of 1.6 W/kg.

The integration of object detection with Knowledge Distillation techniques is expected to play a pivotal role in realizing the full potential of these networks. This study presents Shared Knowledge Distillation (Shared-KD) as a solution to overcome optimization challenges caused by disparities in cross-layer features between teacher–student networks. The significant gaps in intermediate-level features between teachers and students present a considerable obstacle to the efficacy of distillation. To tackle this issue, we draw inspiration from collaborative learning in real-world education, where teachers work together to prepare lessons and students engage in peer learning. Building upon this concept, our innovative contributions in model construction are highlighted as follows: (1) A teacher knowledge augmentation module: this module is proposed to combine lower-level teacher features, facilitating the knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student. (2) A student mutual learning module is introduced to enable students to learn from each other, mimicking the peer learning concept in collaborative learning. (3) The Teacher Share Module combines lower-level teacher features: the specific functionality of the teacher knowledge augmentation module is described, which involves combining lower-level teacher features. (4) The multi-step transfer process can be easily optimized due to the minimal gap between the features: the proposed approach breaks down the knowledge transfer process into multiple steps, which can be easily optimized due to the minimal gap between the features involved in each step. Shared-KD uses simple feature losses without additional weights in transformation, resulting in an efficient distillation process that can be easily combined with other methods for further improvement. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments on popular tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation."",,This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFC3302100).,Electronics,,,,2024-04-22,2024,2024-04-22,,13,8,1595,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Guo, Zhen"; Zhang, Pengzhou;" Liang, Peng"",""Guo, Zhen (State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication, Communication University of China, Beijing 100024, China"; China Unicom Smart City Research Institute, Beijing 100048, China;, liangp@chinaunicom.cn); Zhang, Pengzhou (State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication, Communication University of China, Beijing 100024, China); Liang, Peng (China Unicom Smart City Research Institute, Beijing 100048, China;", liangp@chinaunicom.cn)"",""Guo, Zhen (State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication"; China United Network Communications Group (China));" Zhang, Pengzhou (State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication)"",""Guo, Zhen (State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication"; China United Network Communications Group (China)); Zhang, Pengzhou (State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication);" Liang, Peng (China United Network Communications Group (China))"",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/8/1595/pdf?version=1713782440,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1171008254,""40 Engineering";" 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By concatenating an outer code with polar codes, the distance spectrum can be improved, leading to enhanced decoding performance of vanilla polar codes. In the 5G New Radio standard, both cyclic redundancy check precoding and systematic single-parity-check precoding schemes are adopted and this combination provides stable decoding performance over a wide range of coding parameters. We focus on the design of single-paritycheck precoded polar codes. For the special systematic pre-coding scheme, code construction depends solely on the selection of information and parity bits from the source bits. Since the conventional parity bit selection criteria can draw weaknesses for some coding parameters, we develop new criteria that enhance the protection of weak source bits under the successive cancelation decoding.

These new architectures provide a large usage of advanced machine learning algorithms, in order to dynamically build efficient decisions. In this perspective, the Distributed Learning (D‐), known as A Distributed NWDAF Architecture (D‐NWDAF) has proved its efficiency in not only building collaborative deep learning models, among several network slices, but also ensuring the privacy and isolation of such network slices. Notwithstanding, FL is vulnerable to different attacks, where FL nodes (Leaf NWDAF: AI‐VNFs * ) may upload malicious updates to the FL central (root NWDAF) entity so that it can cause a construction failure of the FL global model and affect the global performance. Moreover, attacks detection of FL‐based solutions give “black‐box” decisions about the performance of running network slices and the attacks detected. In other words, detection solutions do not provide any details about why and how such ML attacks decisions were made. Thus, such decisions cannot be properly trusted and comprehended by B5G slice managers. To resolve this issue, we leverage Dimensional Reduction (DR) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithms which aim to detect attacks and improve the transparency of black‐box FL attacks detection‐making process. In the present article, we design a novel DR‐XAI‐powered framework to detect attacks and explain the FL‐based attacks detection. We first build a deep learning model in a federated way, to predict key performance indicators (KPI) of network slices. Then, we try to detect the malicious FL nodes, using DR and several XAI models, such as RuleFit, in order to enhance the level of trustiness, transparency, and the explanation of the FL‐based attacks detection, while adhering the data privacy, to different B5G network stakeholders."",,,Security and Privacy,,,,2024-06-18,2024,2024-06-18,2024-09,7,5,,Closed,Article,""Saad, Sabra Ben"",""Saad, Sabra Ben (Independent Researcher)"",""Saad, Sabra Ben (Independent Researcher)"",""Saad, Sabra Ben (Independent Researcher)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172959854,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4611 Machine Learning,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This mindset shift moves away from the traditional linear value chain model toward a more collaborative, networked approach. In the manufacturing sector, platform thinking has given rise to new business models like manufacturing as a service (MaaS) and cloud manufacturing (CMfg). In this paper, building upon existing literature, a system dynamics (SD) model is developed to analyze the acceptance of platform thinking as an innovative solution in manufacturing. In contrast to previous studies, the model considers the dynamics of customer behavior in addition to the roles of the platform provider (government) and service providers (manufacturers). The model incorporates four decision variables: commission rates, user membership fees, and subsidies for both cloud platform users and service providers, which can be adjusted to inform policymakers. Studying the effect of individual decision variables over a 30-year time frame using the SD model reveals that increasing commission rates and user membership fees negatively affect the platform size (number of manufacturers joining and staying on the platform), yet can result in increased long-term platform revenue. On the other hand, providing subsidies for cloud platform users and service providers has a positive impact on the platform size but leads to increased costs for the platform provider. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is employed to optimize the system dynamics model and identify optimal policy settings that balance the interests of all stakeholders. This approach enables policymakers to make informed decisions that support the growth of CMfg and MaaS, fostering innovation and competitiveness in the manufacturing sector."",,,Procedia CIRP,,,,2024,2024,,2024,130,,1164-1169,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Mahmoodi, Ehsan";" Fathi, Masood"",""Mahmoodi, Ehsan (Division of Intelligent Production Systems, School of Engineering Science, University of Skövde, P.O.

Within this context, polar codes stand out as a competitive candidate due to their favorable attributes. This study delves into probabilistically-shaped polar-coded modulation (PS-PCM) for its potential to enhance spectral efficiency and error-correction performance, offering a pragmatic design geared towards standardization. Specifically, we present a coding chain for PS-PCM that ensures backward compatibility with legacy 5G polar codes. We also propose, for the first time, a channel-independent method for constructing PS-PCM that eliminates the need for on-the-fly computations, which is an imperative attribute for practical system implementation. The core of this code construction method is the utilization of a surrogate channel to allocate rates to each component code while considering the varying probability distributions and protection levels of label bits. The assigned component code rates can be seamlessly integrated into the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) table to facilitate rapid construction for both base stations and user equipment. Furthermore, we devise flexible rate matching methods to allow fine granularity adjustment of rates and blocklengths for PS-PCM. Simulation results validate the efficacy of our proposed approaches, which also provide insights and benchmarks for the capability of PS-PCM to meet requirements for enhanced spectral efficiency, higher reliability, and more flexibility."",,,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2025-01-29,2025,2025-01-29,,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,""Wu, Bolin"; Niu, Kai; Dai, Jincheng;" Yuan, Yifei"",""Wu, Bolin (Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China)"; Niu, Kai (Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China); Dai, Jincheng (Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China);" Yuan, Yifei (Future Mobile Technology Lab, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China)"",,""Wu, Bolin (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China)"; Niu, Kai (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China); Dai, Jincheng (Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China);" Yuan, Yifei (China Mobile (China))"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1185040097,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, FP is expensive as its life cycle management requires recording reference signals for initial training and when the environment changes. Instead, novel channel charting technologies are significantly cheaper. Because they implicitly assign relative coordinates to radio signals, they require few reference coordinates for localization. However, even channel charting still requires data acquisition and reference signals, and its localization is slightly less accurate than FP. In this article, we propose a novel channel charting framework that does not require references and dramatically reduces life-cycle management. With velocity information, e.g., pedestrian dead reckoning or odometry, we model relative charts. And with topological map information, e.g., building floor plans, we transform them into real coordinates. In a large-scale study, we acquired two realistic datasets using 5G and single-input and multiple-output distributed radio systems with noisy velocities and coarse map information.

Contrary to the fifth-generation (5G) mobile network that focuses only on communications, 6G mobile networks must natively support new capabilities such as sensing, computing, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and security while facilitating Everything as a Service. Although 5G mobile network deployment has demonstrated that network automation and intelligence can simplify network operation and maintenance (O&M), the addition of external functionalities has resulted in low service efficiency and high operational costs. In this study, a technology framework for a 6G autonomous radio access network (RAN) is proposed to achieve a high-level network autonomy that embraces the design of native cloud, native AI, and network digital twin (NDT). First, a service-based architecture is proposed to re-architect the protocol stack of RAN, which flexibly orchestrates the services and functions on demand as well as customizes them into cloud-native services. Second, a native AI framework is structured to provide AI support for the diverse use cases of network O&M by orchestrating communications, AI models, data, and computing power demanded by AI use cases. Third, a digital twin network is developed as a virtual environment for the training, pre-validation, and tuning of AI algorithms and neural networks, avoiding possible unexpected losses of the network O&M caused by AI applications.

Light field video (LFV), considered an intermediate transition scheme towards the metaverse, is conducive to sensing and reconstructing realistic scenes in the digital twins. However, the research on LFV systems still lacks comprehensive investigation, impeding their practical application. This paper addresses major technical challenges involved in LFV delivery through mobile networks, showing a trade-off between equipment cost, calibration effort, and workflow simplicity. It also considers the balance of communications and computations latency when maintaining reconstruction performance. Leveraging edge and cloud infrastructure, a novel Mobile Edge Assisted Multi-view Light-field-video System (MEAMLS) is proposed, integrating LFV collection, volumetric video construction, and an immersive viewing scheme. A custom-made LFV capture array is designed to capture real-world scenes, while employing a learning method-integrated edge server to facilitate adaptive LFV coding. Moreover, a fast sparse reconstruction algorithm is established, leveraging edge–cloud collaboration to minimize computation latency during volumetric video construction. Intelligent service for users is deployed on edge to enable viewport-driven virtual reality viewing. By providing an immersive visual experience, the proposed MEAMLS bridges the physical world and its digital twins. The system is prototyped on a realistic 5G network to empirically validate the performance under static and dynamic circumstances. Experimental results yield fundamental insights for designing mobile edge networks-assisted LFV system from the perspective of transmission resource, adaptability, and deployment."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Although the dataset is decentralized among training devices in federated learning, the model parameters are usually stored in a centralized manner. Centralized federated learning is easy to implement";" however, a centralized scheme causes a communication bottleneck at the central server, which may significantly slow down the training process. To improve training efficiency, we investigate the decentralized federated learning scheme. The decentralized scheme has become feasible with the rapid development of device-to-device communication techniques under 5G. Nevertheless, the convergence rate of learning models in the decentralized scheme depends on the network topology design. We propose optimizing the topology design to improve training efficiency for decentralized federated learning, which is a non-trivial problem, especially when considering data heterogeneity. In this paper, we first demonstrate the advantage of hypercube topology and present a hypercube graph construction method to reduce data heterogeneity by carefully selecting neighbors of each training device—a process that resembles classic graph embedding. In addition, we propose a heuristic method for generating torus graphs. Moreover, we have explored the communication patterns in hypercube topology and propose a sequential synchronization scheme to reduce communication cost during training. A batch synchronization scheme is presented to fine-tune the communication pattern for hypercube topology. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed graph construction methods can accelerate the training process, and our sequential synchronization scheme can significantly reduce the overall communication traffic during training."",,,Intelligent and Converged Networks,,,,2024-06,2024,,,5,2,100-115,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Duan, Yubin"; Li, Xiuqi;" Wu, Jie"",""Duan, Yubin (Temple University,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Philadelphia,PA,USA,19122)"; Li, Xiuqi (Temple University,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Philadelphia,PA,USA,19122);" Wu, Jie (Temple University,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Philadelphia,PA,USA,19122)"",,""Duan, Yubin (Temple University)"; Li, Xiuqi (Temple University);" Wu, Jie (Temple University)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.23919/icn.2024.0008,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173957042,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4611 Machine Learning,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For further utilization, researches on attaching grasping function devices such as manipulators and grippers to quadcopters are gaining attention. Device mounting significantly impacts flight due to weight and center-of-gravity shifts. We developed a self-folded origami gripper (SOG) based on paper self-folding technology. The SOG consists of a bistable structure and a multilayer cylindrical structure. The origami structure is created by self-folding technology using ink-jet printing, which gives the paper elastic hinges and rigidity. The optimal parameters for designing the grasping function of the SOG were identified to improve the grasping performance. The SOG itself weighs only 5g, yet it demonstrated grasping force equivalent to holding a 130g object in the grasping force experiment. Eventually, the developed SOG was mounted on a quadcopter, and flight-grasping experiments were successfully conducted. The developed SOG is made entirely of paper, a biodegradable material. When the SOG falls to the ground due to an accident or deterioration, it is expected to be used as a green grasping device that returns to the soil and does not destroy the environment."",The authors would like to thank V.

In particular, Universal Hash Functions (UHF) are crucial primitives used as core components in many popular modes of operation for various use-cases, such as Message Authentication Codes (MACs), authenticated encryption, wide block ciphers, etc. In this paper, we extend and improve upon existing design approaches and present a general framework for the construction of UHFs, relying only on the AES round function and 128-bit word-wide XORs. This framework, drawing inspiration from tweakable block ciphers design, allows both strong security arguments and extremely high throughput. The security with regards to differential cryptanalysis is guaranteed thanks to an optimized MILP modelling strategy, while performances are pushed to their limits with a deep study of the details of AES-NI software implementations. In particular, our framework not only takes into account the number of AES-round calls per message block, but also the very important role of XOR operations and the overall scheduling of the computations.We instantiate our findings with two concrete UHF candidates, both requiring only 2 AES rounds per 128-bit message block, and each used to construct two MACs. First, LeMac, a large-state primitive that is the fastest MAC as of today on modern Intel processors, reaching performances of 0.068 c/B on Intel Ice Lake (an improvement of 60% in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art). The second MAC construction, PetitMac, provides an interesting memory/throughput tradeoff, allowing good performances on many platforms."",,,IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology,,,,2024-06-18,2024,2024-06-18,,2024,2,35-67,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Bariant, Augustin"; Baudrin, Jules; Leurent, Gaëtan; Pernot, Clara; Perrin, Léo;" Peyrin, Thomas"",""Bariant, Augustin (Inria, Paris, France"; ANSSI, Paris, France); Baudrin, Jules (Inria, Paris, France); Leurent, Gaëtan (Inria, Paris, France); Pernot, Clara (Inria, Paris, France); Perrin, Léo (Inria, Paris, France);" Peyrin, Thomas (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore)"",,""Bariant, Augustin (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation"; Inria, Paris, France; ANSSI, Paris, France); Baudrin, Jules (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation); Leurent, Gaëtan (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation); Pernot, Clara (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation); Perrin, Léo (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation);" Peyrin, Thomas (Nanyang Technological University)"",0,0,,,https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/download/11619/11111,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173039083,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The emergence of 5 G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology has fostered a coupling between EV and base stations, further enhancing their roles within the power grid. Building upon this foundation, this paper proposes a scheduling strategy for demand response in flexibility resources under the 5 G-V2X framework. Initially, the dispatchable load of EV is examined in conjunction with the traffic network. Subsequently, we consider the communication power consumption resulting from the connected vehicle model, enabling us to devise path planning and charging navigation strategies for EV. Lastly, we establish a scheduling decision model that aims to minimize both the operation costs of base stations and the variance in grid load. The simulation is validated using real-world road conditions in the primary urban area of a city. The findings illustrate that the proposed dispatching strategy not only achieves a mutually beneficial outcome for EV users and aggregators, without disrupting EV charging and discharging processes, but also enhances the capability of demand response, thereby ensuring reliable grid operation."",""Declaration of Competing Interest No conflict of interest exist in the submission of this manuscript, and manuscript is approved by all authors for publication.

Prior studies on DT within the context of next generation wireless technologies have primarily focused on identifying potential use cases, application scenarios, standardization challenges, and conceptual implementation steps. However, the existing research is limited in translating theoretical ideas into real-world applications. Our research, in this paper, contributes to the practical realization of DT technology in the context of 6G wireless networks, demonstrating its potential impact on network planning, performance, and user experience. In particular, we explore the construction, validation, and applications of DT utilizing an indoor over-the-air (OTA) 5G NR testbed powered by an in-house developed Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) that is fully compliant with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Open RAN standards. First, we explain the integration and implementation steps followed to integrate Qualcomm EdgewiseTM Suite and Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) tools into the NG-RAN architecture, that will eventually enable the applicability of DT for wireless network operations. We then describe our procedure to construct and validate a high-fidelity DT of our OTA testbed modeling both Radio Frequency (RF) environment and system components. We demonstrate two pre-deployment use cases by describing our extensive coverage estimation and network capacity planning tests in OTA. Lastly, we explore how DT enables practical machine learning solutions for post-deployment use cases and share our comprehensive OTA performance results, highlighting that our proposed mobility and positioning techniques outperform the classical approaches in terms of throughput, number of undesired handovers, and positioning accuracy."",""The authors would like to thank Swarup Dwaral, Vinay Garg, Sukruth Babu, Prabhu Ramani Iyer, Sandeep Jangid, Rachit Srivastava, Rahul Ankushrao Kawadgave, Aaron Bailey, Shubham Agrawal, Hemanshu Tyagi, Yun Lin, Tao Liu, Varun Rajpal, and Vince Baglin, for their technical expertise and contributions to the work presented in this article.

"444,pub.1185440564,10.1002/adfm.202425148,,,Engineering Structural Anisotropy for Visualizing and Controlling Nanomagnetic Interactions with High‐Frequency Electromagnetic Wave,""Abstract Structural anisotropy in micro‐ and nanoscale magnetic materials is critical for their magnetic response to high‐frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields. However, controlling and visualizing these magnetic properties at the nanoscale remains a significant challenge. In this study, it proposes a strategy for the directional regulation of anisotropy in iron‐based magnetic materials. By manipulating particle structures, preferential orientation designs are achieved, resulting in spherical, spindle‐shaped, symmetrical hexagonal cone‐shaped, and disc‐shaped morphologies. Utilizing off‐axis electron holography and micromagnetic simulations, it observes that the material's response to high‐frequency EM waves intensifies with increasing structural anisotropy. This enhanced anisotropy directly influences high‐frequency magnetic permeability, enabling effective modulation of EM waves. Building on these insights, spindle‐shaped magnetic structures are developed with strong uniaxial anisotropy, achieving enhanced microwave absorption and surpassing the Snoek limit. These structures exhibit an initial permeability of up to 2.03, a 35% improvement over isotropic structures. They cover the 4.58–7.88 GHz range, providing absorption across more than 50% of the wireless communication band with a thin coating of just 3.0 mm, outperforming existing absorbers.

Existing solutions typically require the presence of a line-of-sight path and the knowledge of the transmitter’s location. In this paper, these requirements, we propose a novel uplink sensing scheme to relieve these requirements by introducing static anchor points for the first time. The scheme consists of two efficient algorithms. The first algorithm estimates the relative timing and carrier frequency offsets, with respect to a randomly selected reference snapshot. Its estimation performance is analyzed with closed-form bias and root mean squared error derived. The estimates from the first algorithm are then used to eliminate clock offsets, enabling the construction of angle-Doppler maps. Using the maps, the second algorithm is developed to identify anchor points and then locate the transmitter and dynamic targets. The impact of the locations of the transmitter and anchor points is also analytically illustrated. Extensive simulation results are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed sensing scheme in practical 5G communication setups and its superiority over prior art in terms of noise resilience and asymptotic performances."",,,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2024-08-16,2024,2024-08-16,2025-02-01,73,2,904-920,All OA";" Green,Article,""Hu, Yanmo"; Zhang, J.

The FPGA devices embed a hardwired or soft processing system (PS) which communicates with the programmable logic (PL) using a standard embedded bus interface. In order to apply a seamless run-time partial reconfiguration, we made use of all the related building blocks, design guidelines, and tools offered by AMD-Xilinx. In ReproRun, each partial bitstream targeting a reconfigurable region (RR) of the PL area comes with its respective firmware (i.e., software functions) that runs on the PS side. Our work guarantees run-time updates of the firmware without interrupting the functionality of other software processes running in the PS or PL, by employing a specialized controller, denoted as Run-timE firmWare reconfIguration contRollEr (REWIRE). The latter leverages the open asymmetric multiprocessing framework (OpenAMP). The partial bitstreams and respective firmware are fetched from a remote location using the trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP).

The 2D sparse FIR filter has multiple trapezoid-shaped passbands pertaining to wideband beams aimed at particular directions. The proposed multibeam digital beamformer drives a uniform linear array of wideband antenna elements to achieve the wideband multibeam transmit-mode signals desired by the communication system. The 2D sparse FIR filter is designed to be optimal in the minimax sense using convex optimization techniques. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations using real antenna models confirm that the proposed wideband transmit beamformer can achieve multibeam transmission in the 1.3–2.8 GHz frequency range, with more than 70% fractional bandwidth. Furthermore, the adoption of the wideband transmit multibeam beamformer leads to a significant reduction in digital arithmetic (computational) complexity compared with previously reported wideband transmit beamformers of similar transfer function type, without deteriorating beam directionality and causing increases in the side-lobe level. The proposed sparse 2D FIR multibeam beamformer architecture is well-suited for both sub-6 GHz (legacy) band transmit beamforming, frequency range three (FR3) beamforming up to 28 GHz, and mmWave operation for emerging 5G/6G applications."",,""This research was partly supported by National Science Foundation (NSF), USA under the grant NSF SWIFT 2229471 and Senate Research Committee, University of Mortuwa under the grant SRC/LT/2020/08."",Journal of Low Power Electronics and Applications,,,,2024-04-28,2024,2024-04-28,,14,2,26,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Dissanayake, Nadeeshan"; Edussooriya, Chamira U.

However, the communication requirements of users, the manufacturing and launching costs of satellites, and the performance coverage of constellations pose significant challenges to the construction of SIoT. To facilitate the evolution of the 5G network into the 6G space-ground integrated network, this article proposes a multiarea on-demand classification (MOC) constellation design based on CubeSats. First, the area of interest is classified into two categories: 1) the area with cellular base stations and 2) the area without cellular base stations. Second, three coverage, communication quality, and cost models are established. The coverage model establishes the initial configuration of the constellation and determines the value for evaluating coverage. The communication model determines the evaluation values for communication quality. The cost model determines the evaluation values for cost. Finally, the multiobjective Manta ray foraging optimization (MOMRFO) algorithm optimizes the three evaluation values to obtain the Pareto front for the best configuration constellation. Based on actual data from the cellular base station, the simulation results have demonstrated the MOC constellation scheme’s feasibility and effectiveness for future SIoT deployment."",,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-04-09,2024-01-01,11,13,23889-23905,Closed,Article,""Tang, Xiangrong"; Xu, Yongnan; Huang, Linyu; Ning, Qian;" Ullah, Hamid"",""Tang, Xiangrong (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China)"; Xu, Yongnan (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China); Huang, Linyu (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China); Ning, Qian (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China);" Ullah, Hamid (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China)"",""Ning, Qian (Sichuan University)"",""Tang, Xiangrong (Sichuan University)"; Xu, Yongnan (Sichuan University); Huang, Linyu (Sichuan University); Ning, Qian (Sichuan University);" Ullah, Hamid (Sichuan University)"",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170590706,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the increasing number of intelligent devices joining the MMSN poses a growing threat to network security. Current Artificial Intelligence (AI) intrusion detection techniques turn intrusion detection into a classification problem, where AI excels. These techniques assume sufficient high-quality instances for model construction, which is often unsatisfactory for real-world operation with limited attack instances and constantly evolving characteristics. This paper proposes an Adaptive Personalized Federated learning (APFed) framework that allows multiple MMSN owners to engage in collaborative training. By employing an adaptive personalized update and a shared global classifier, the adverse effects of imbalanced, Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data are mitigated, enabling the intrusion detection model to possess personalized capabilities and good global generalization. In addition, a lightweight intrusion detection model is proposed to detect various attacks with an effective adaptation to the MMSN environment. Finally, extensive experiments on a classical network dataset show that the attack classification accuracy is improved by about 5% compared to most baselines in the global scenarios."",""Acknowledgements This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62371181, the Project on Excellent Postgraduate Dissertation of Hohai University (422003482), and the Changzhou Science and Technology International Cooperation Program under Grant CZ20230029."",,Digital Communications and Networks,,,,2024-02,2024,,2024-02,,,,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Su, Xin";" Zhang, Guifu"",""Su, Xin (College of Information Science and Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, 213200, China)";" Zhang, Guifu (College of Information Science and Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, 213200, China)"",""Su, Xin (Hohai University)"",""Su, Xin (Hohai University)";" Zhang, Guifu (Hohai University)"",7,7,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcan.2024.02.001,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168713964,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, network resources are characterized by diversity and decentralization, and how to effectively promote the interconnection and comprehensive sharing of resources that belong to different resource providers to meet the demands of diversified services is a critical issue.

" With the rapid development of 5G communication technology and intelligent detection technology, electromagnetic shielding/infrared stealth fabrics with Joule/solar heating performance can meet the needs of wearable electronic devices for multi-application scenarios. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are ideal candidates for constructing efficient conductive networks in EMI SE fabrics due to their layered structure and high conductivity. However, it is difficult for MXene nanosheets to assemble into excellent interconnected conductive networks due to the irregular size and stacking of MXene sheets after MXene etching. Inspired by transport of nutrients by roots, a three-dimensional (3D) efficient conductive network was constructed by bridging one-dimensional (1D) Ag nanowires (AgNWs) into the highly conductive 2D MXenes, and a series of flexible multifunctional MXene@AgNW/cotton fabrics with excellent EMI SE performance was obtained. The average EMI SE value of MXene@AgNW/cotton fabrics can reach 70.6 dB in the X band. The oxidation resistance of the fabric is enhanced after spraying perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES) on the surface, and the surface water contact angle reaches 135.1°, providing excellent self-cleaning performance. MXene@AgNW/cotton fabric exhibits an average infrared emissivity of 0.25 (3–5 μm) and 0.17 (8–14 μm), showing excellent camouflage capability for infrared thermal signals under an infrared camera, generating a temperature difference of about 132.2 °C with a hot stage at 200 °C. MXene@AgNW/cotton fabric shows good electrical heating performance under low voltage loading (temperature reaches 150 °C at 3.5 V) and it also exhibits photothermal properties, showing a temperature of 120 °C under light density irradiation of 1900 W m −2 within 180 s, which can realize the functions of hot compress therapy and cold preservation. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) value of MXene@AgNW/cotton fabric is 27.5%, which proves that MXene@AgNW/cotton fabric exhibits fire safety in practical applications.

However, despite their significant potential, the performance gains achieved in practical environments do not consistently scale with the accompanying rise in hardware costs. To address this issue, we delve into the design of rectangular array structures for massive MIMO with varying parameters. The core idea is to optimize the array structure to suit diverse propagation characteristics. Our approach treats the massive MIMO array as a spatial sampling system. A two-dimensional Fourier transform concerning the elevation and azimuth steering factors is employed to derive the angular spectrum of incoming signals at the base station. Building on spatial spectrum analysis, we unveil the relationship between antenna array parameters, such as the number of antennas and the vertical/horizontal antenna spacings, and the spatial resolution and spectral aliasing inherent to the massive MIMO system. Furthermore, we investigate how array structure parameters impact channel capacity in multi-user scenarios and propose effective strategies for enhancing capacity while mitigating aliasing through parameter adjustments. Finally, we present numerical results that validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

This study focuses on demonstrating how machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to predict path loss within the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum in a specific indoor environment. We address high-frequency challenges like path loss and complex building layouts that impact signal propagation. We employ various ML models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), hybrid models integrating linear regression, ANNs, and Gaussian Processes, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to predict and analyze the propagation loss in a controlled indoor setting. The models were trained and validated using data collected from a comprehensive measurement campaign at 28 GHz, which involved high precision radio equipment in a complex indoor environment. Our results demonstrate that while traditional models provide a baseline for understanding path loss, advanced ML models, particularly hybrid approaches, significantly enhance prediction accuracy and provide a deeper understanding of indoor propagation dynamics within this specific environment. The study highlights the potential of ML in overcoming the limitations of empirical models and showcases methodologies that can be adapted for similar indoor scenarios.

In private 5G networks, deficiency of labeled data, domain specificity, and model uncertainty are three main challenges in intent classification. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a large language models (LLMs) based classification method with automatic text annotation (ATA). Firstly, a Brown bridge Evolutionary Algorithm (BBGA) is designed to create and optimize a Chain-of-Thought(CoT) dataset, which reduces the dependence on the original classification labels. Specifically, BBGA contains two innovative modules, i.e., evolution and evaluator. In the evolution module, a text search structure is designed by modifying attention weights rather than by adjusting the decoding parameter. In the evaluator, to enhance the domain focus and semantic focus, the Brown bridge characteristic is utilized to establish a joint CoT evaluation mechanism. Secondly, the LLMs perform two-stage CoT fine-tuning. Finally, the paper employs a fine-tuned classifier with a confidence evaluation strategy to increase the proportion of correct answers in the sample space of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ATA classification method has superior performance and higher certainty than baseline methods."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Computer Networks,,,,2025-03,2025,,2025-03,259,,111074,Closed,Article,""Li, Binglei"; Liu, Tong; Ma, Jian; Dai, Jingwei;" Liao, Peizhen"",""Li, Binglei (Department of Wireless and Device Technology Research, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, 100032, China)"; Liu, Tong (Department of Wireless and Device Technology Research, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, 100032, China); Ma, Jian (Department of Wireless and Device Technology Research, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, 100032, China); Dai, Jingwei (Department of Wireless and Device Technology Research, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, 100032, China);" Liao, Peizhen (Department of Networks, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., 100032, Beijing, China)"",""Li, Binglei (China Mobile (China))"",""Li, Binglei (China Mobile (China))"; Liu, Tong (China Mobile (China)); Ma, Jian (China Mobile (China)); Dai, Jingwei (China Mobile (China));" Liao, Peizhen (China Mobile (China))"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1184944514,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This enables the base station to overcome the influence of NLOS and receive the positioning signal of the point to be positioned. Then, the angular domain power expectation matrix of the received signal is extracted as a fingerprint to form a partial fingerprint database. Next, the complete fingerprint database is reconstructed using the low-rank matrix fitting algorithm, thereby considerably reducing the workload of building the fingerprint database. Finally, maximal ratio combining is used to increase the gap between the fingerprint data, and the Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN) algorithm is used to match the fingerprint data and estimate the location of the points to be located.

At a filling ratio of 20 wt% and a thickness of 1.8 mm, the Co/CNFs achieves a minimum reflection loss of −45 dB, extending the effective absorption bandwidth to 4.6 GHz. Performance assessment through power loss density (PLD) and radar cross-section (RCS) simulations evaluates the material’s capabilities, confirming the enhanced performance of Co/CNFs compared to the perfect electrical conductor (PEC). This efficient preparation method holds substantial potential for practical applications and serves as a comprehensive guide for achieving a balance between high performance, efficiency, and cost-advantages."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The proposed antenna array utilizes waveguide sections with radiating elements (grooves) positioned on the outer side and a feeder at a specific distance from the planar input surface. The radiating elements in each waveguide section are symmetrically at a distance from the planar input surface, determined mathematically to ensure in-phase excitation. The design simplifies construction by eliminating the need for a separate mirror component, thereby increasing the gain coefficient by reducing shading and scattering effects. The methodology involves arranging waveguide sections in a single plane, with radiating elements positioned to create an excitation field with specific amplitude and phase distributions. The theoretical framework is based on using waveguide structures with periodically placed irregularities to produce a pencil beam radiation pattern. The proposed antenna has been carefully studied using CST microwave studio software. Key results of the proposed design include a main lobe directivity of 29.9 dBi, a side lobe level (SSL) of -14.8 dB, width of radiation pattern of 3.6° at 37.5 GHz, and an impedance bandwidth of $S_{11} \lt -10$ dB from 28 to 34.4 GHz and 34.9 to 37.9 GHz, validating the antenna’s effectiveness."",,This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University through a Large Group Research Project under Grant RGP.2/167/45.,IEEE Access,,,,2024-12-13,2024,2024-12-13,2025-01-01,13,,15079-15089,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Hussein, Hany S."; Ismeil, Mohamed; Yasseen, M.

Many existing ML techniques utilize a city map to construct the radio map";" however, an updated city map may not always be available. This paper proposes to employ the received signal strength (RSS) data to jointly construct the radio map and the virtual environment by exploiting the geometry structure of the environment. In contrast to many existing ML approaches that lack of an environment model, we develop a virtual obstacle model and characterize the geometry relation between the propagation paths and the virtual obstacles. A multi-screen knife-edge model is adopted to extract the key diffraction features, and these features are fed into a neural network (NN) for diffraction representation. To describe the scattering, as oppose to most existing methods that directly input an entire city map, our model focuses on the geometry structure from the local area surrounding the transmitter and receiver, and the spatial invariance of such local geometry structure is exploited. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing a 3D virtual environment, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in radio map construction with $10\%- 18\%$ accuracy improvements. It can also reduce 20% data and 50% training epochs when transferred to a new environment."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62171398"; in part by the Basic Research Project of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong (HK) Science and Technology (S&T) Cooperation Zone under Grant HZQB-KCZYZ- 2021067; in part by NSFC under Grant 62293482; in part by Shenzhen Science and Technology Program under Grant JCYJ20220530143804010, Grant KJZD20230923115104009, and Grant KQTD20200909114730003; in part by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Grant 2024A1515011206; in part by Guangdong Research under Grant 2019QN01X895, Grant 2017ZT07X152, and Grant 2019CX01X104; in part by Shenzhen Outstanding Talents Training Fund under Grant 202002; in part by Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Future Networks of Intelligence under Grant 2022B1212010001; in part by Guangdong-HK-Macau Joint Laboratory for Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz under Grant 2023B1212120002; in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1800800;" and in part by the Key Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province under Grant 2018B030338001."",IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,,,,2024-11-05,2024,2024-11-05,2024-12-01,23,12,19804-19819,All OA";" Green,Article,""Chen, Wangqian";" Chen, Junting"",""Chen, Wangqian (School of Science and Engineering, Shenzhen Future Network of Intelligence Institute (FNii-Shenzhen), and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Future Networks of Intelligence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518172, China)";" Chen, Junting (School of Science and Engineering, Shenzhen Future Network of Intelligence Institute (FNii-Shenzhen), and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Future Networks of Intelligence, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518172, China)"",""Chen, Junting (Chinese University of Hong Kong)"",""Chen, Wangqian (Chinese University of Hong Kong)";" Chen, Junting (Chinese University of Hong Kong)"",0,0,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00229,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1182069314,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was used in this study to examine the effect of the coupling agent on the properties of a composite-produced using pineapple leaf fibre. The weight ratios of pineapple leaf fibre, polypropylene, and MAPP were 20g:180g, 15g:180g:5g, and 10g:180g:10g, respectively. The materials were mixed using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder machine at 170 °C and 50 rpm. The composite was then manufactured by injection molding at 185 °C. The mechanical and physical properties of PALF composite were examined by using a tensile test, impact test, and water absorption test. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was used to characterize the thermal properties of PALF/PP, and PALF/PP/MAPP composite. The surface morphology and fracture surface of the composite was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Compared to the composite containing 5 g of MAPP, the tensile strength composite containing 10 g of MAPP produced a stronger interfacial bond. According to the impact test, adding more MAPP increases the material's strength and stress transmission. The average percentage of water absorption indicates low water absorption after the addition of the coupling agent.

At present, increasing the bandwidth of erbium‐doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) is the most effective way to increase the communication capacity. In this paper, a hybridization strategy is proposed for simultaneous achieving strong and flat optical response and demonstrate the success in construction of Er 3+ ‐Tm 3+ co‐doped gadolinium aluminosilicate glass fiber for L‐band optical amplification. Gd 3+ ions are introduced to enhance the radiative transition by improving the dispersibility of Er 3+ . Tm 3+ ions are co‐introduced to facilitate energy transfer between Er 3+ and Tm 3+ for achieving flat emission in the L‐band. The hybridized active fiber which can be effectively fused with quartz fiber is fabricated by melt‐in‐tube (MIT) approach.

Recent reports anticipate that Fifth-Generation (5G) technology subscriptions are expected to surpass 5.3 billion by 2029. Notably, the majority of cellular network traffic originates from densely populated urban areas, where the urban environment poses numerous challenges for wireless signal quality, stemming from its densely packed infrastructures, such as high-rise buildings, narrow-congested roads/streets, metallic structures, vehicular traffic, and more. As a result, cellular operators face challenges in ensuring improved QoS for end users, along with a defined level of Quality-of-Experience (QoE). With this objective in mind, this research conducts a comparative evaluation of the User Equipment-Base Station (UE-BS) association, aiming to comprehend the throughput experiences of UEs during mobility and to evaluate the wireless services delivered with promised QoE levels. The findings of this research highlight a significant improvement in the throughput performance of priority UEs when served by BSs, with the highest Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) levels and lower UE loads. Additionally, it is demonstrated that a network characterized by low UE load at the BSs contributes to enhanced throughput performances of priority UEs, attributed to surplus bandwidth resources, thereby resulting in improved UE QoE."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-07-11,2024-01-01,12,,97994-98003,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Ullah, Inam"; Sayed, Hesham El; Malik, Sumbal;" Khan, and Manzoor Ahmed"",""Ullah, Inam (College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"; Emirates Center for Mobility Research (ECMR), UAE University (UAEU), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Sayed, Hesham El (College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Emirates Center for Mobility Research (ECMR), UAE University (UAEU), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Malik, Sumbal (College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates);" Khan, and Manzoor Ahmed (Nokia Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, 07974, USA)"",""Sayed, Hesham El (United Arab Emirates University";" Emirates Center for Mobility Research (ECMR), UAE University (UAEU), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates)"",""Ullah, Inam (United Arab Emirates University"; Emirates Center for Mobility Research (ECMR), UAE University (UAEU), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Sayed, Hesham El (United Arab Emirates University; Emirates Center for Mobility Research (ECMR), UAE University (UAEU), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates); Malik, Sumbal (United Arab Emirates University);" Khan, and Manzoor Ahmed (Nokia (United States))"",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2024.3426991,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173754009,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4613 Theory Of Computation,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The fifth-generation wireless standard (5G) uses polar codes as a coding technique. Concerning short- to intermediate or long-length codes, the polar decoding fails to repair errors in successive cancellation (SC) decoding sufficiently. Still, by employing successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding, SC decoding can more effectively rectify errors. The main disadvantage of SCL is its increased cost driven by throughput and computational complexity. Building polar codes over an AWGN channel with little computational cost remains an ongoing research issue. Therefore, to address the shortcomings of the SC/SCL decoders, the Simplified successive cancellation (SSC) decoder of polar codes with an improved Gaussian Approximation (GA) technique over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is proposed in this work. Compared to the density evolution technique, the SSC decoder with GA will more easily trace the mean log-likelihood ratio (LLR). The SSC decoder is examined using a GA technique at high and low code rates and lengths. The capacity effects of PCs concerning performance metrics like bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) are realized in detail at various code lengths.

In this work, reduced graphene oxide-MXene (rGMH) @FeNi/epoxy EMI shielding composites with a regular honeycomb structure were successfully prepared by the combination of surface functionalization modification, sacrificial template, and freeze-drying. The effects of magnetic FeNi alloy particle loading mode and loading amount on the EMI shielding performance of composites were investigated. The results show that rGMH@FeNi/epoxy EMI shielding composites have the highest EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) and the lowest reflection shielding effectiveness when magnetic FeNi alloy particles are loaded only on the graphene skeleton. In this composite, the EMI SE value of the composite is 61 dB when the rGMH@FeNi mass fraction is 5.4 wt% (f-FeNi mass fraction is 0.9 wt%), which is 4.7 times that of the blended rGO/MXene/FeNi/ epoxy resin composite (13 dB) with the same mass fraction. At the same time, the rGMH@FeNi/epoxy composite has excellent thermal stability (heat-resistance index of 190.3 °C) and mechanical properties (energy storage modulus of 8606.7 MPa).

However, guaranteeing the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements through efficient resource allocation remains a formidable challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising solution, conventional online RL methodologies typically necessitate direct interactions with practical wireless networks during training, posing potential risks to URLLC services if suboptimal actions are taken. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel offline data-driven optimization framework for designing radio resource allocation algorithms. Inspired by the dynamic nature of the wireless network inherently captured in the historical operation data traces, our proposed framework takes advantage of offline RL to optimize resource allocation policies solely from offline datasets, thus avoiding the risks associated with online training on practical networks. Moreover, to effectively characterize dynamic fluctuations in the number of active users, our framework incorporates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where the GNN-based architecture can enhance the policies' scalability and generalization capabilities, enabling the learned policies to adapt to evolving network conditions. Building upon this framework, we propose a novel radio resource allocation algorithm, namely GNN-based offline RL (GNN-ORL). Extensive experimental results validate the performance of the proposed GNN-ORL algorithm. Specifically, GNN-ORL exhibits both stable convergence and excellent generalization capabilities, and outperforms baseline schemes in meeting the QoS requirements of URLLC services."",,""This work was supported in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant L222003 and Grant L242011, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62101067 and Grant 62101030, and in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2024YFE0200300."",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2024-11-18,2024,2024-11-18,,74,3,4510-4525,Closed,Article,""Jing, Wenpeng"; Wang, Junzhe; Ren, Jiaqi; Lu, Zhaoming; Shao, Hua;" Wen, Xiangming"",""Jing, Wenpeng (Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks and Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"; Wang, Junzhe (Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks and Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Ren, Jiaqi (Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks and Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Lu, Zhaoming (Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks and Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Shao, Hua (Institute of Artificial Intelligence, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, 100083, China);" Wen, Xiangming (Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Networks and Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"",""Jing, Wenpeng (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Jing, Wenpeng (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"; Wang, Junzhe (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Ren, Jiaqi (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Lu, Zhaoming (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Shao, Hua (University of Science and Technology Beijing);" Wen, Xiangming (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1182476009,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4611 Machine Learning,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, a novel and multi-functional flame retardant ((diphenylphosphoryl)azanediyl)bis(ethane-2,1-diyl) bis(diphenylphosphinate) (DPEP) containing multiple flame retardant groups and polyaromatic structure was innovatively designed. The prepared TPU/DPEP composites exhibited excellent fire safety, UV shielding, mechanical and transparent properties. 4 wt% DPEP enabled TPU to pass the UL-94 V-0 rating and improved the LOI to 29.6 %. Compared to pure TPU, the heat release rate and total heat release of TPU/4 wt% DPEP were decreased by 29.06 % and 13.24 %. Meanwhile, TPU/DPEP composites achieved 100 % UV shielding at UV-B wavelengths and up to 68.77 % UV isolation at UV-A wavelengths. Due to the structural similarity and processing meltability, DPEP exhibited good dispersion and compatibility in TPU matrix. TPU/DPEP retained almost the same mechanical and transparent properties as pure TPU. The condensed and gas phase analysis indicated that the flame retardant mode of DPEP was mainly dominated by flame retardant inhibition and the barrier effect of the carbon layer. Compared with the reported flame retardant TPU composites, the TPU/DPEP composites achieved a relatively optimal balance between efficient flame retardant, mechanical, UV shielding, and transparent properties, demonstrating great application prospects in the emerging fields."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

A unique composite Electromagnetic Band-Gap (EBG) structure consisting of a vertical six rings positioned between single element antennas were devised and investigated with the aim of reducing mutual interaction between antenna components. A distinct feeble electric field that could successfully inhibit the Mutual Coupling (MC) among the antenna components is easily produced by the suggested composite EBG construction. One type of decoupling constructions throughout the antenna growth was carefully examined at together the theoretical and physical levels in order to offer a clear representation of the suggested antenna array’s design concept and decoupling technique. The antenna array design process was cleverly separated into three stages. In order to verify the suggested decoupling idea, the array Scheme was constructed, assessed, and measured. Studying the antenna gain, radiation pattern, and reflection coefficient, it was found that the simulated and measured findings were very consistent. According to the models, the array has an extreme radiation efficiency of about 91%, a minor value of Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC < 1.8 × 10−4), and a maximal gain of 11.5 dBi. The electrical size, highest isolating grade and the recommended MIMO antenna’s 90 dB isolating bandwidth (BW) were assessed. The planned antenna has several appealing features that set it apart from previous similar designs. These features include a low design complexity, a great Diversity Gain rate (DG > 9.99 dB), the BW of the proposed antenna extends from 25 GHz to more than 40 GHz, an enormously great isolation level (about 90 dB), and compressed dimensions (51 mm × 30 × 1.6 mm). For verifying the recommended antenna for MIMO. the suggested MIMO antenna design’s radiation efficiency, a thorough time-domain study is suggested."",The authors would like to thank the respected editors and the reviewers for their helpful comments.,""Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB).

Meanwhile, the silanization reaction between the Silica and Si69 was introduced to improve the performance of the CNTs/EG/SSBR composite. When comparing the sample prepared using the two‐stage mixing process based on the shear flow field in the internal mixer, the continuously prepared CNTs/EG/SSBR composite with 3 wt% CNTs and 15 wt% EG demonstrates a higher thermal conductivity of 1.32 W/m·K. At the same time, it exhibits significant advantages in terms of mechanical properties, processability and dispersion rating. In addition, the mechanism for the continuous preparation of CNTs/EG/SSBR composite was revealed through visual experiments. This study aims to achieve the real continuous production of high‐performance thermally conductive polymer composites to meet the urgent demand for thermal conductivity materials in 5G technology.   Highlights    Real continuous preparation of CNTs/EG/SSBR composite was realized.   The silanization index of 92.26% between Silica and Si69 was achieved.

Achieving this optimization is critical for mitigating thermal failure in electronic devices and enhancing their operational reliability and service life. A 3D CTO-Cu/epoxy (EP) dielectric composite has been successfully fabricated by reverse-infiltrating epoxy into a pre-constructed 3D network of calcium titanate (CTO) decorated with copper nanoparticles. The continuous 3D CTO architecture, created via a facile sol-gel process, ensures uniform distribution of copper (Cu) nanoparticles throughout the structure, synergistically enhancing the overall performance of 3D CTO-Cu/EP composite. Moreover, in virtue of the equivalent micro-capacitors and the Coulomb-blockade effect generated by the Cu nanoparticles, the dielectric properties of the 3D CTO-Cu/EP composites were significantly enhanced, while the dielectric loss was simultaneously and effectively suppressed—an achievement that is particularly challenging to realize. The 3D CTO-0.2Cu/EP system achieved the highest dielectric constant of 28.0 (at 1 kHz) and the lowest dielectric loss of 0.021, which are 184% and 70% improvements over the 3D CTO/EP composite, respectively, offering an effective method to adjust the dielectric and energy storage properties of polymer-based dielectrics."",Declaration of Competing Interest ☑ The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,""This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52177020";52107018;51937007; 52277155, 52103054), the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2021QE269), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (202241004), and the student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project of Liaocheng University (CXCY2022184;" CXCY2023015)."",Ceramics International,,,,2025-03,2025,,2025-03,51,8,10582-10589,Closed,Article,""Yang, Yongzhi"; Liu, Xiaoqian; Li, Yuchao; Lu, Minghui; Zhang, Ziyu; Zhan, Yanhu; Li, Yankai; Dang, Zhi-Min; Zhong, Shao-Long; He, Dongxin;" Shi, Zhicheng"",""Yang, Yongzhi (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China)"; Liu, Xiaoqian (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China); Li, Yuchao (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China); Lu, Minghui (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China); Zhang, Ziyu (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China); Zhan, Yanhu (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China); Li, Yankai (School of Materials Science and Engineering, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, 252059, China); Dang, Zhi-Min (Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 10084, P.R.

"400,pub.1172575644,10.1109/tmlcn.2024.3410211,,,Decentralized Aggregation for Energy-Efficient Federated Learning in mmWave Aerial-Terrestrial Integrated Networks,""It is anticipated that aerial-terrestrial integrated networks incorporating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounted relays will offer improved coverage and connectivity in the beyond 5G era. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning technique for building inference models over wireless networks due to its ability to maintain user privacy and reduce communication overhead. However, off-the-shelf FL models aggregate global parameters at a central parameter server (CPS), increasing energy consumption and latency, as well as inefficiently utilizing radio resource blocks (RRBs) for distributed user devices (UDs). This paper presents a resource-efficient and decentralized FL framework called FedMoD (federated learning with model dissemination), for millimeter-wave (mmWave) aerial-terrestrial integrated networks with the following two unique characteristics. Firstly, FedMoD incorporates a novel decentralized model dissemination scheme that uses UAVs as local model aggregators through UAV-to-UAV and device-to-device (D2D) communications. As a result, FedMoD 1) increases the number of participant UDs in developing the FL model";" and 2) achieves global model aggregation without involving CPS. Secondly, FedMoD reduces FL’s energy consumption using radio resource management (RRM) under the constraints of over-the-air learning latency. To achieve this, by leveraging graph theory, FedMoD optimizes the scheduling of line-of-sight (LOS) UDs to suitable UAVs and RRBs over mmWave links and non-LOS UDs to available LOS UDs via overlay D2D communications. Extensive simulations reveal that FedMoD, despite being decentralized, offers the same convergence performance to the conventional centralized FL frameworks."",,This work was supported in part by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Postdoctoral Fellowship and in part by NSERC Discovery Grant Programs.,IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-06-05,2024-01-01,2,,1283-1304,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Saif, Mohammed"; Hassan, Zoheb;" Hossain, Jahangir"",""Saif, Mohammed (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 1A1, Canada)"; Hassan, Zoheb (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Université Laval, Québec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada);" Hossain, Jahangir (School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, V1V 1V7, Canada)"",""Hassan, Zoheb (Université Laval)"",""Saif, Mohammed (University of Toronto)"; Hassan, Zoheb (Université Laval);" Hossain, Jahangir (University of British Columbia)"",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmlcn.2024.3410211,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172575644,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software; 4613 Theory Of Computation,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Historically, the past few decades have already witnessed much progress in THz generation and detection technologies, which have been recognized for a long time as the bottleneck preventing the THz waves from being tamed by human beings. However, the importance of developing advanced components such as antennas, transmission lines, filters, power amplimers, etc., which constitute the basic building blocks of a THz wireless system, should not be overlooked for the sake of exploiting the THz spectra for future advanced wireless communications, sensing and imaging applications. While producing a scannable highly-directive antenna beam proves to be indispensable in the period of microwaves, the significance of such functionality is more critical in the THz era, considering that THz waves have more intractable challenges such as the severity of free-space propagation losses, the susceptibility to atmospheric environments, and the unavailability of efficient signal sources. This article is structured under this background, which is dedicated to reviewing several enabling beam-scanning antenna concepts, structures, and architectures that have been developed for THz wireless systems. Specifically, we divide these THz beam-scanning solutions into four basic groups based on different mechanisms, i.e., mechanical motion, phased array, frequency beam-scanning, and reconfigurable metasurfaces."",""Declaration of interests The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The synergy between IoT devices and 5G cellular networks has further accelerated this transformation, providing ultra-high data rates and ultra-low latency. This connectivity enables various applications, including remote surgery, autonomous driving, virtual reality gaming, and AI-driven smart manufacturing. However, IoT devices’ real-time and high-volume messaging nature exposes them to potential malicious attacks. The implementation of encryption in such networks is challenging due to the constraints of IoT devices, including limited memory, storage, and processing bandwidth. In a previous work [1], we proposed an ongoing key construction process, introducing a pivotal pool to enhance network security. The protocol is designed with a probability analysis to ensure the existence of a shared key between any pair of IoT devices, with the predefined probability set by the system designer. However, our earlier model faced vulnerabilities such as the “parking lot attack” and physical attacks on devices, as highlighted in the conclusion section. We present a complementary solution to address these issues, fortifying our previous protocol against cyber threats. Our approach involves the implementation of an internal Certification Authority (CA) that issues certificates for each IoT device before joining the network. Furthermore, all encryption keys are distributed by the primary IoT device using the Unix OS ‘passwd’ mechanism. If a device “disappears,” all encryption keys are promptly replaced, ensuring continuous resilience against potential security breaches. This enhanced protocol establishes a robust security framework for IoT networks, safeguarding against internal and external threats."",,,IgMin Research,,,,2024-02-12,2024,2024-02-12,2024-02-12,2,2,084-096,Closed,Article,""Guy, Leshem";" Menachem, Domb"",""Guy, Leshem ()";" Menachem, Domb ()"",,""Guy, Leshem ()";" Menachem, Domb ()"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169010612,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this type of peer to peer network, nodes are self-configurable and communicate among themselves wirelessly. Typically, these nodes are powered by batteries and move continuously within the specified region. In order to provide efficient communication between these devices, several routing protocols have been designed. However, most of the schemes focus on construction ofshortestroute. With this approach, it is not always possible to provide reliable and efficient path in highly dynamic environment to carry out data transmission process. In this paper, a novel Adaptive and Stable Multipath Routing Scheme (ASTMRS) has been proposed in which only peer nodes with good fitness values are allowed to process route request packet. This fitness value is estimated based on node mobility, residual energy and distance metrics. Further, each node updates its next hop information on the basis of node degree and received signal power. Simulation has been conducted under various network scenarios such as packet rate and pause time. Under different scenarios, an average improvement of 15.82% and 14.38% has been seen in packet delivery ratio(PDR) and throughput respectively";" other performance metrics such as normalized routing load (NRL) and delay have been reduced to 15.58% and 13.95% respectively against AOMDV.

For spectrum allocation, two methodologies have been adopted for CR between users who are licensed (PU) and those who are not (SU). They are spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay. Secondary users need to operate below the principal users' noise level therefore, significant restrictions resisted on the strength of their transmission in spectrum underlay methodology. Spectrum underlay is a type of underlay that is used in the construction of the unoccupied section of the spectrum searched by CR in the spectrum overlay process. A reconfigurable antenna is needed on RF front-end side of CR, which will a range of completely to span a vast array of frequencies specified sub-bands of frequency, and this is often a major design challenge. An antenna with a flexible monopole for Ultra-wideband equipment competent to function between the frequency range of 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. Designs of reconfigurable antennas reported in the literature are mostly observed to be capable of manual tuning or switching between two or a few frequency bands. Hence, the requirement of new designs of integrated UWB and reconfigurable narrowband antennas that operate from 2 GHz and up to 12 GHz frequency range with a high degree of automated tunability or switching facility into different narrow bands would have a strong application potential for CRs."",,,Recent Advances in Electrical & Electronic Engineering (Formerly Recent Patents on Electrical & Electronic Engineering),,,,2024-01-19,2024,,2024-01-19,17,,,Closed,Article,""C, Anjani";" Muduli, Arjuna"",""C, Anjani (Koneru Lakshmaiah Education foundation, Vijayawada-522302, India";);" Muduli, Arjuna (JSPM University, Nagar road, Wagholi, Pune412207, India)"",,""C, Anjani (Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation)";" Muduli, Arjuna (JSPM University, Nagar road, Wagholi, Pune412207, India)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168552307,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the current sidelink communication design focusing on information dissemination or point-to-point communication with a low rate is not suitable for rapid development of such autonomous systems. Instead, based on sidelink, developing distributed wireless personal area networks (WPANs) with a drastically higher rate for transmitting user data is essential. The overarching goal of this study is to explore the possibility of sidelink communication evolution to 1) form a distributed and autonomous WPAN and 2) support millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. Our core idea is to merge several design concepts of the precedented mmWave WPAN standards, i.e., IEEE 802.15.3c/11ad, into the sidelink communications, thereby bridging the gap between the two separated systems. This article presents the anatomy of the IEEE 802.15.3c/11ad system with a focus on the formation of mmWave WPANs among distributed nodes and their operation. In addition, the current status of sidelink communication system design is highlighted, along with the missing building blocks, which are required to develop 3GPP sidelink-based mmWave WPAN systems. Simulation results shed light on merging IEEE 802.15.3c/11ad concepts into 3GPP sidelink communication regarding a control data transmission scheme, which should be designed to enhance robustness and is a crucial step for subsequent high-rate user data transmission."",,This work was supported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan (SCOPE) under Grant JPJ000595.,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2024-01-01,2024,2024-05-31,2024-01-01,11,21,34592-34616,All OA";" Hybrid,Article,""Koda, Yusuke"; Okura, Ryogo;" Harada, Hiroshi"",""Koda, Yusuke (Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan)"; Okura, Ryogo (Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan);" Harada, Hiroshi (Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan)"",""Koda, Yusuke (Kyoto University)"",""Koda, Yusuke (Kyoto University)"; Okura, Ryogo (Kyoto University);" Harada, Hiroshi (Kyoto University)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/jiot.2024.3399249,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172303206,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Enriching heterointerface polarization relaxation through nanostructure design and interface modification has proven to be an effective strategy to obtain efficient electromagnetic wave absorption. Here, this work implements an innovative method that combines biomimetic honeycomb superstructure to constrain hierarchical porous heterostructure composed of Co/CoO nano-particles to improve the interfacial polarization intensity. The method effectively controlled the absorption efficiency of Co2+ through de-lignification modification of bamboo, and combined with the bionic carbon-based natural hierarchical porous structure to achieve uniform dispersion of nanoparticles, which is conducive to the in-depth construction of heterogeneous interfaces. In addition, the multiphase structure brought about by high-temperature pyrolysis provides the best dielectric loss and impedance matching for the material. Therefore, the obtained bamboo-based Co/CoO multiphase composite showed excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance, achieving excellent reflection loss (RL) of −79 dB and effective absorption band width of 4.12 GHz (6.84–10.96 GHz) at low load of 15wt%. Among them, the material’s optimal radar cross-section (RCS) reduction value can reach 31.9 dB·m2.

The User Plane Function (UPF) is responsible for efficient data traffic forwarding and is envisioned as a key and pioneering core network function that will be deployed on satellites. However, managing and providing services with satellite UPFs face dual challenges. Limited satellite resources constrain the user scale that a satellite UPF can service, resulting in an unguaranteed service delay. Moreover, the extremely rapid mobility of satellites renders it difficult for satellite UPFs to provide seamless services. To address the above challenges, this paper presents the first-of-its-kind service optimization scheme for satellite UPFs in terms of switch control, state migration, and traffic routing. To provide guaranteed service delay, we provide a theoretical analysis based on the M/G/1 queue model, demonstrating the service delay-resource consumption trade-off. A satellite UPF switch control scheme is integrated into the service optimization process, which can decrease satellite UPF service delay while saving satellite resources by adjusting the switch control parameters. To provide seamless services, we propose a satellite UPF-oriented state-aware service migration and traffic routing (UPF service optimization) algorithm. A policy network-based reinforcement learning approach is employed to dynamically perceive the satellite network’s state as well as the satellite UPF switch state. Building upon the optimization of service delay through satellite UPF switch control, the processes of state-aware state migration and traffic routing are further employed to reduce delay, ensuring seamless service effectively. Experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms under different metrics. The service delay is reduced by an average of 23.2% compared with other algorithms."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62032003, Grant 62372061, Grant 62425203, and Grant U21B2016, in part by the BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation under Grant CX20242013, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2024ZCJH11."",IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,,,,2024-11-08,2024,2024-11-08,,24,4,2564-2579,Closed,Article,""Wang, Chao"; Ma, Xiao; Xing, Ruolin; Li, Sisi; Zhou, Ao;" Wang, Shangguang"",""Wang, Chao (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"; Ma, Xiao (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Xing, Ruolin (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Li, Sisi (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China); Zhou, Ao (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China);" Wang, Shangguang (State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, 100876, China)"",""Ma, Xiao (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",""Wang, Chao (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"; Ma, Xiao (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Xing, Ruolin (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Li, Sisi (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications); Zhou, Ao (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications);" Wang, Shangguang (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1182130190,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A notable problem is the shift of statistical properties in real-world streaming over time caused by unexpected factors, referred to as concept drift, which results in less efficient predictive models. To address this problem, the latest research leverages the cloud–edge continuum paradigm for the deployment of AI and general smart city applications while utilising the available resources optimally. In this article, we propose a computing architecture for different smart city applications in edge micro data centre (EMDC) settings over a hybrid cloud–edge continuum to support the deployment of AI workloads. We implement a feedback-driven automated concept drift detection and adaptation methodology, combining base learner long short-term memory (LSTM) with Page–Hinkley test (PHT), adaptive windowing (ADWIN) and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov windowing (KSWIN). Real-world data streams are utilised to forecast from various environmental sensors installed at the University of Oulu Smart Campus. The feedback-based concept drift detection and adaption process is first evaluated using synthetic datasets with known concept drift points and then employed in the real-world data. Subsequently, the implementation is evaluated using the state-of-the-art MAE, RMSE, and MAPE methods. The results showed a reduction in MAPE from 8.5% to 3.88% when concept drift detection was applied.

As vehicles act as workers in many traffic-oriented crowdsourcing systems, there's a growing focus on how to get high-quality reports when some vehicles may be malicious or selfish. Some researchers assign reputation values to vehicles and select high-reputation vehicles to complete tasks, but these efforts still have shortcomings. In model design, guaranteeing the objectivity of reputation calculation, suppressing malicious and selfish behaviors, and maximizing the utilities of honest vehicles and service providers should be considered simultaneously. In system construction, reputation verification service in multi-party intelligent transportation scenarios and reputation management system performance should be satisfied. In this paper, we propose $\mathcal {R}$-manager, a consortium blockchain-based vehicle reputation management scheme. Firstly, we design a reputation model that uses confirmed results to update reputation and suppress malicious and selfish behaviors based on reputation deposit forfeit and a tax mechanism. Besides, the model maximizes the utilities of crowdsourcing participants by reaching the game equilibrium. Secondly, we design a reputation management system based on a consortium blockchain to abstract management activities as transactions and verify them by executing smart contracts, which meet multi-party management and reputation verification needs. Moreover, we design a half-committee endorsement strategy to improve system performance. Finally, our model is verified by simulation, and it can better suppress malicious and selfish behaviors compared with three different reputation models. We implement a prototype system and evaluate its performance. $\mathcal {R}$-manager outperforms two state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1005500, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702288, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Southeast University."",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2024-09-11,2024,2024-09-11,,74,1,984-999,Closed,Article,""Yu, Enze"; Xu, Yuwei; Gao, Lin; Cao, Jie; Xiang, Qiao;" He, Liang"",""Yu, Enze (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China)"; Xu, Yuwei (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China; Purple Mountain Laboratories for Network and Communication Security, Nanjing, 211111, China); Gao, Lin (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China); Cao, Jie (School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 211189, China); Xiang, Qiao (School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361000, China);" He, Liang (School of Computing, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, 68512, USA)"",""Xu, Yuwei (Southeast University";" Purple Mountain Laboratories)"",""Yu, Enze (Southeast University)"; Xu, Yuwei (Southeast University; Purple Mountain Laboratories); Gao, Lin (Southeast University); Cao, Jie (Southeast University); Xiang, Qiao (Xiamen University);" He, Liang (University of Nebraska–Lincoln)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1175649908,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem evolve with more number of connected vehicles, handling of the enormous data is a challenge. This is overcome with the promising distributed edge intelligence (DEI) approach in which the computational tasks are distributed among the intelligent road side units (RSUs) at the network edge. The edge servers cooperate among themselves so as not to overload the central cloud server. This article presents a cooperative vehicular communication network which exploits the existing 5G infrastructure in roadside building as the edge/relay nodes. To overcome the communication and energy overhead, network resource management is enabled through proposed edge node selection algorithm. Further, a joint edge node and antenna selection algorithm is proposed for enhanced energy efficiency (EE) and reduced outage. The closed-form expression for the outage probability of the proposed cooperative communication scheme is derived. Our analysis shows that the proposed selection approach achieves improved outage probability and energy-efficiency. In particular, the proposed edge node selection approach improves the EE by 10.46% at total transmit power to noise power ratio of 16 dB. Moreover, the overall system performance is further enhanced by proposing a joint selection scheme.

With the wide applications of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology in 5G communication and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication, the BMC of OFDM signals is of great significance. The existing modulation classification (MC) methods of OFDM signals mainly focus on incomplete blind classification, and the receiver still needs to obtain some prior information. The BMC of asynchronous OFDM signals with completely unknown signal parameters and channel information still has some technical challenges. This article proposes a blind classification method for asynchronous OFDM signals and a feature engineering mechanism based on normalized statistical dispersion of amplitude (NSDA) and high-order statistics by designing a perceptual processing method combining discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and self linear convolution (SLC). This helps solve such a problem that the recognizability of OFDM signals is not obvious at a low SNR. At last, a synthetic minority over-sampling technique—deep neural network (SMOTE-DNN) classifier is designed to significantly enhance the classification accuracy of OFDM blind classification. By building a software radio experimental platform, BMC experimental verification is conducted on the OFDM RF signals whose subcarriers are modulated by binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), minimum frequency shift keying (MSK), 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), 64-QAM, 4-PAM, and 8-PAM. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can realize BMC of asynchronous OFDM signals without prior information in various scenarios, and the comprehensive classification accuracy reaches 87.5% at a SNR of 0 dB."",,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 62031017.,IEEE Sensors Journal,,,,2024-01-03,2024,2024-01-03,2024-01-15,24,14,22117-22128,Closed,Article,""Yang, Yuxiao"; Yang, Junkai; Xu, Chang;" Shen, Xiaobo"",""Yang, Yuxiao (Department of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 211106, China)"; Yang, Junkai (Spacecraft Communication and Telemetry and Command (SCTC) Research Group, Department of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 211106, China); Xu, Chang (Spacecraft Communication and Telemetry and Command (SCTC) Research Group, Department of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 211106, China);" Shen, Xiaobo (Spacecraft Communication and Telemetry and Command (SCTC) Research Group, Department of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 211106, China)"",""Yang, Junkai (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)"",""Yang, Yuxiao (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)"; Yang, Junkai (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics); Xu, Chang (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics);" Shen, Xiaobo (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)"",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1167635724,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this literature review, a search for articles related to the metaverse in education, published in 2022 and 2023, has been conducted across six databases: Scopus, EBSCO Host, ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis Online, IEEE Xplore, and Springer. The PRISMA methodology was used to analyze and systematize the manuscripts found. The aim of this research was to examine how integrating the metaverse into education can enhance educational accessibility and equity by enabling students to utilize virtual learning resources and opportunities. In addition, they can engage in interactions with others to learn and create interactive content during the teaching and learning process. This requires a commitment from the student because a connection between the student and the machine will be established through the use of emerging technologies. These technologies offer unique opportunities to enhance teaching quality, broaden access to education, and prepare individuals for an increasingly digital and evolving world. The analysis identified 14 emerging technologies: artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, blockchain, augmented reality, extended reality, virtual reality, 5G, EON-XR, digital twins, 3D virtual reality, and immersive virtual reality. These technologies offer immersion (simulation of a real world in a virtual world), interactivity (interaction with different people), improvement of the educational environment (innovative presentation of content), and motivation for learning (capturing attention). When it comes to the different types of learning, there are six categories: experiential (based on experience), collaborative (involving a guide to lead the process), cooperative (involving teamwork), significant (building on existing knowledge), explicit (self-directed learning), and emotional (involving the regulation of emotions)."",,,International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy (iJEP),,,,2024-01-30,2024,2024-01-30,,14,1,61-81,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Flores-Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella"; Olaya-Cotera, Sandro;" Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando"",""Flores-Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella (UNIVERSIDAD CESAR VALLEJO)"; Olaya-Cotera, Sandro (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola);" Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú)"",,""Flores-Castañeda, Rosalynn Ornella (Universidad César Vallejo)"; Olaya-Cotera, Sandro (Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola);" Iparraguirre-Villanueva, Orlando (Universidad Autónoma del Perú)"",3,3,,,https://online-journals.org/index.php/i-jep/article/download/42421/14537,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168411213,40 Engineering"; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,4 Quality Education;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"383,pub.1170002393,10.1002/pc.28323,,,Carboxylated cellulose composite film fabricated via layer‐by‐layer self‐sssembly for thermal management material with ultra‐high thermal conductivity,""Abstract   With the development of 5G equipment, aerospace, sensors, thermal management devices and other fields in the direction of high power, high performance and miniaturization, the heat released during usage increases significantly, leaving great application prospects for heat dissipation materials. In spite of great attention paid to film materials due to their light weight and flexibility, they have the obvious disadvantage of poor thermal conductivity. In this work, carboxylated cellulose (CNF‐C)/dopamine‐coated nickel‐coated graphene (PDA‐Ni@GNS) composite films with high in‐plane thermal conductivity (in‐plane TC) have been fabricated by a simple vacuum‐assisted filtration method. In the prepared composite films, the flaky packing layers were found to be stacked orderly and form an excellent thermally conductive network, resulting in an increase in in‐plane TC by 322.1% (sample W4) as compared with that of neat films. By comparing the in‐plane TCs of the composite films with that of a commercial gasket, it was readily seen that the present composite films had fairly excellent heat dissipation properties. The composite exhibits not only sufficiently high in‐plane TC and tensile strength of 149.02 MPa but also exhibits hydrophobic property, imparting the composite films good working stability under extreme conditions, which ensured of their potential applications in thermal management materials.   Highlights    The introduction of Ni promotes the construction of heat conduction path.   High in‐plane TC is obtained through layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly.   The modification of filler enhanced the mechanical properties of the films.   The modification of fillers led to the hydrophobicity of the film.   The introduction of PDA made the films have insulating properties."",""ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52103111), University Collaborative Innovation Projects of Anhui Province (GXXT‐2019‐001), National College Students&#x27"; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program (202210357034 and 202210357070), Key Projects of Anhui Provincial Department of Education for Universities (KJ2020A0023 and KJ2021A0034).

"381,pub.1181375205,10.1109/tvt.2024.3481014,,,Non-Uniform Pilot Pattern Design for Sparse Channel Estimation in MIMO-OFDM Systems,""In this paper, we propose a non-uniform pilot pattern based on the cyclic difference set (CDS) for sparse channel estimation in multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. The CDS-based pilot patterns can effectively enhance the performance of sparse channel estimation by applying compressed sensing (CS) techniques. However, the existing CDS pilot patterns are limited to single-input-single-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SISO-OFDM) systems. In MIMO-OFDM systems, as the required number of CDS increases, there will be a growing number of intersecting (overlapping) elements among different CDSs (antennas), thus introducing significant interference among different antennas. To tackle this problem, a special CDS property called identical multi-set intersection (IMI) property is disclosed which can significantly reduce the inter-antenna interference. In addition, two constructions of desired CDS collection $\bf D_{I}$ having such IMI property are presented. To further eliminate the residual interference due to the remaining intersecting elements, i.e. the exact $\lambda$ overlapping positions among all antennas, two pilot placement algorithms, i.e., zero setting (ZS) and partial orthogonal cover coding (POCC), are proposed to achieve orthogonal pilot patterns in frequency. Our simulation results show that our proposed MIMO non-uniform IMI CDS pilot patterns exhibit superior estimation accuracy, closely approaching that of SISO systems. Furthermore, our MSE simulation results also show that, under the same condition, the proposed IMI CDS pilot scheme significantly outperforms the 3GPP 5G NR MIMO-OFDM pilot schemes, offering better estimation performance while maintaining much lower generating complexity compared with other existing multi-antenna pilot schemes."",,This work was supported by NSFC under Project 62020106001 and Project U23A20274.

"365,pub.1172243844,10.59671/d65b7,,,Proposal of Digital Twin-Enabled New Product Design Framework,""Digital twin (DT) has provided numerous opportunities for product development businesses to leverage data acquired from the physical model. Ideally, many companies are improving their use cases by using the collected physical data in a virtual model. Thanks to emerging communication technologies, 5th generation mobile network (5G), the internet of things (IoT), industrial internet of things (IIoT) sensors, etc., which help to collect data from the physical product and send data to cloud computing, called big data. With the gap in the non-availability of standard architecture, many companies are using big data and building their digital models. This paper proposes a novel DT-enabled new product design framework that has built an interaction between the DT and product design environments. This framework enables the data to be captured from various physical entities, stored in a centralized location, and pushed into the digital entity, which processes the data and converts the raw data into information used for decision-making. In the digital entity, multiple technologies are used to process data into information, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models, mathematical models, and simulation models. The processed data that emerges from these models are called synthetic or DT data";" this data is later used for control / monitoring and visualization / interaction purposes. In this paper, the data classified as visualization and interaction is integrated with the new product design framework in all four design stages, viz., concept design, detailed design, design verification, and redesign, with various data contributions to the design. A case study was discussed by applying the DT data processed using the AI / ML model in the concept design phase. Using synthetic data, the medium-duty truck frame assembly�s design concept was validated using ten load cases iteratively, and the design was finalized. The results are encouraging that the overall weight of the frame assembly was optimized by 9% without impacting the strength and factor of safety of the frame assembly."",,,Interciencia,,,,2024,2024,2024,2024,,,,Closed,Article,""M, Chandrasekaran";" PK, Rajesh"",""M, Chandrasekaran ()";" PK, Rajesh ()"",,""M, Chandrasekaran ()";" PK, Rajesh ()"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1172243844,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science;" 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,""9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Wireless network operators must strive to improve performance in order to be competitive, whilst reducing costs in order to be profitable. State-of-the-art technology informs the future direction of the industry but network operators’ operational and commercial needs also need to inform the direction of research. This industrial review sheds light on an ongoing technological convergence from the viewpoint of wireless network operators that hold direct responsibility in deploying new networking technologies. An evolving paradigm called the “Smart Wireless Environment” (SWE) brings together disparate research topics in revolutionising physical layer networking. A critical role of SWE is to overcome, or significantly mitigate, the service degradation due to fading wireless channels. Therefore, we focus our attention to a pragmatic, narrow-sense application of SWE, which we term as network stabilization. Besides classic end-to-end (E2E) fading countermeasures, network operators could also adopt SWE to augment the propagation background in complex real-life environments. Akin to the synthesis of a filter with flat response, stabilized artificial fading channels can be engineered from augmented scattering clusters (ASCs). The ability to tailor the fading channel response could offer a network operator useful competitive advantage. However, the SWE paradigm is still at a low technology readiness level (TRL). The challenge is for operators to work out how to cost-effectively implement SWE to deliver real user benefit, building on the present-day installed network. To this end, we provide a technical analysis of the synergy between SWE enablers: holographic metasurfaces to augment the environment, wireless sensing to monitor the environment, and machine intelligence to control the environment. The expected performance advantages of SWE are numerically investigated. Finally, major roadblocks in SWE commercialization are also identified."",""The work of Yangyishi Zhang, Khethiwe Mhlope Ziwenjere, and Fraser Burton was supported in part by the Horizon Europe 2020 MSCA DN Project INTEGRATE under Grant 101072924 and in part by EPSRC under Grant EP/X031977/1.

In the era of the digital economy, modern information technology is profoundly changing the way governments govern, the production mode of enterprises, and the living behavior of residents. Whether digital technology can bring ecological welfare needs to be further studied. Based on panel data from 269 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2021, this study empirically examines the impact of digital technology on air pollution by using the two-way fixed effect model. The results show that digital technology will significantly reduce the concentration of fine particles in the air and help protect the atmospheric environment. The results are still valid after using the interactive fixed effect model and the two-stage least square method after the robustness test and causality identification. Digital technology can also reduce the air pollution by promoting green innovation, improving energy efficiency, and easing market segmentation. The effect of digital technology on reducing the concentration of fine particles in the air is heterogeneous. Digital technology plays a more substantial role in reducing pollution in resource-based cities and areas with a high degree of modernization of the commodity supply chain. The positive effect of digital technology in reducing air pollution is affected by the amount of air pollutants emitted. When the concentration of PM2.5 in the air is high, the role of digital technology in protecting the atmosphere will be strongly highlighted. This research is a beneficial exploration of protecting the atmospheric environment by using digital technology while building an ecological civilization society. The conclusion will help urban managers, the public, and business operators entirely use modern equipment such as 5G, remote sensing, and the Internet of Things in their respective fields to protect the atmospheric environment."",,This work was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (grant number: 2022J01320).,Systems,,,,2024-02-05,2024,2024-02-05,,12,2,55,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Shen, Yang";" Zhang, Xiuwu"",""Shen, Yang (Institute of Quantitative Economics, Huaqiao University, Xiamen 361021, China)";" Zhang, Xiuwu (Institute of Quantitative Economics, Huaqiao University, Xiamen 361021, China)"",""Zhang, Xiuwu (Huaqiao University)"",""Shen, Yang (Huaqiao University)";" Zhang, Xiuwu (Huaqiao University)"",6,6,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/12/2/55/pdf?version=1707131412,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168617746,41 Environmental Sciences"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recently, polymer‐based composites with the fillers of hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN) have been regarded as promising candidates resulting from their excellent thermal conductivity (TC), good insulation and remarkable comprehensive properties. However, the high surface inertness of h‐BN itself, incompatibility with matrix and other fillers and mismatch of phonon‐spectrum will bring about the matrix/filler and filler/filler interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), which will greatly decline the TC of the composites, and limit their thermal management ability. Therefore, how to design, regulate and improve the interfacial states in composites and eventually enhance the TC is a current challenge. Researchers have made great effort to reduce the ITR of the composites to improve their TC. However, a comprehensive summary and analysis of researches on the improvement methods of the interface states in composites in the past 3 years is still lacking. In this work, the commonly used mechanism models, and simulation methods for calculating and predicting TC was summarized. From perspectives of Synthesis of h‐BNNs, modification, orientation, bridging and three‐dimensional structures construction, we reviewed strategies for improving the interface states in composites, and focused on the ITR regulation and TC improvement. The improvement effects of various methods on TC were compared. The development trend of high TC composite materials was prospected.   Highlights    Crystallinity, defect, size, flatness, thickness of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) affect interfacial thermal resistance (ITR).   Nature of interaction between adjacent layers of BNNS need exploited.   Interface and defect are root cause of extra phonon scattering.

"359,pub.1184911881,10.1016/j.jisa.2025.103981,,,Merkle multi-branch hash tree-based dynamic data integrity auditing for B5G network cloud storage,""In the Beyond 5th Generation (B5G) mobile communication network, data transmission speed will be higher, and communication time latency will be minimized, it also brings new security challenges to data management and privacy protection. Aiming at the problems faced by the data integrity audit for B5G network cloud storage, such as complex dynamic data updating, a large number of users, we propose a Merkle Multi-branch Hash Tree (MMHT)-based data integrity auditing scheme for B5G network cloud storage. The scheme involves five entities and eight phases. We propose a multi-branch double-linked Merkle Hash Tree structure to store and audit dynamic data. We conduct correctness analysis and security analysis to this scheme. The results show that our scheme can meet the requirements of data integrity audit and counter six types of data integrity attack. We conduct theoretical comparative analysis. Compared with other schemes, the computational overhead of data owner (DO) is reduced by m times (m represents the number of data blocks). Relevant experiments are conducted with a 5G real-world dataset, and the experiments show that on the order of million data, the construction time of MHT is about 2.48 times that of MMHT in terms of Merkle tree. The verification time of MHT is about 12.83 times that of MMHT. When the data scale reaches millions, the time to generate user keys in the 4G environment is 6.49 times that of in the B5G environment. When the number of bilinear pairings reaches one million, the verification time of Third-Party Auditors (TPA) for 10,000 encrypted data entries is only 1.07 times that of 1,000 entries, indicating that our scheme can be scaled for use with large datasets. Compared with other schemes, our solution improves the efficiency and security of dynamic data integrity auditing in the B5G network environment."",""Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

"342,pub.1169879327,10.3390/app14062538,,,Analysis of the Influence of Antenna Arrangement Parameters on the Aerodynamic Performance of Telecommunication Towers,""With the widespread adoption of 5G telecommunication networks, to reduce construction costs, it has become necessary to add new equipment or antennas to existing 4G and 3G telecommunication towers. This significantly changes the original aerodynamic shape of the towers, leading to a substantial increase in the wind load, which may exceed the original structure’s bearing capacity and pose a threat to the structure’s safety. This study employed three-dimensional numerical simulation methods to systematically investigate the impact of various antenna arrangement parameters, such as the arrangement number, arrangement form, and arrangement layers, on the wind load characteristics of telecommunication towers. The findings revealed that the antenna arrangement form significantly affects the sensitivity of the telecommunication tower’s wind load to the wind direction, with more uniform antenna arrangements resulting in less sensitivity. Compared to the drag coefficient and the windward base overturning moment coefficient, the tower’s lateral force coefficient and the crosswind base overturning moment coefficient are more sensitive to changes in the wind direction. The change patterns in the tower’s overturning force coefficient and overturning moment coefficient with the antenna arrangement number are essentially the same. However, as the antenna arrangement number increases, the growth rate of the tower’s overturning moment coefficient is about twice that of the overturning force coefficient. The tower’s overturning force coefficient increases approximately linearly with the increase in antenna arrangement layers, while the tower’s overturning moment coefficient exhibits a nonlinear increase with the increase in antenna arrangement layers. The rate of increase in the wind load with the antenna arrangement layers is significantly greater than that with the antenna arrangement number. Thus, to reduce wind load, it is advisable in practical engineering applications to increase the antenna arrangement number per layer, thereby reducing the antenna arrangement layers. The study also summarized a calculation method for the structural wind load of telecommunication towers, taking into account the influence of antenna arrangement parameters, providing a reliable basis for the structural design and safety assessment of telecommunication towers in practical engineering."",,""This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 52208495, and the Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, China, grant number E2021210110."",Applied Sciences,,,,2024-03-18,2024,2024-03-18,,14,6,2538,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Jia, Yaya"; Huang, Jiachen; Liu, Qingkuan; Zhao, Zonghan;" Dong, Menghui"",""Jia, Yaya (School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China";, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and System Safety of Traffic Engineering Structures, Shijiazhuang 050043, China; Innovation Center for Wind Engineering and Wind Energy Technology of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050043, China); Huang, Jiachen (School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.)); Liu, Qingkuan (School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and System Safety of Traffic Engineering Structures, Shijiazhuang 050043, China; Innovation Center for Wind Engineering and Wind Energy Technology of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050043, China); Zhao, Zonghan (School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.)); Dong, Menghui (School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);", dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.))"",""Jia, Yaya (Shijiazhuang Tiedao University"; School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and System Safety of Traffic Engineering Structures, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;" Innovation Center for Wind Engineering and Wind Energy Technology of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050043, China)"",""Jia, Yaya (Shijiazhuang Tiedao University"; School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and System Safety of Traffic Engineering Structures, Shijiazhuang 050043, China; Innovation Center for Wind Engineering and Wind Energy Technology of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050043, China); Huang, Jiachen (Shijiazhuang Tiedao University; School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.)); Liu, Qingkuan (Shijiazhuang Tiedao University; School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Behavior and System Safety of Traffic Engineering Structures, Shijiazhuang 050043, China; Innovation Center for Wind Engineering and Wind Energy Technology of Hebei Province, Shijiazhuang 050043, China); Zhao, Zonghan (Shijiazhuang Tiedao University; School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);, dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.)); Dong, Menghui (Shijiazhuang Tiedao University; School of Civil Engineering, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China;, 1202101022@student.stdu.edu.cn, (J.H.);, qk@stdu.edu.cn, (Q.L.);, zzh546429965@163.com, (Z.Z.);", dddmh12138@163.com, (M.D.))"",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/6/2538/pdf?version=1710743994,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1169879327,40 Engineering"; 4005 Civil Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditional helmets, designed primarily for head protection, have evolved into multi-functional devices equipped with cutting-edge features that address safety, communication, and convenience. Smart helmets transcend their fundamental role, incorporating advanced functionalities such as real-time health monitoring, accident detection, and GPS navigation to meet modern safety challenges. This paper delves into the concept, design, and development of a smart helmet prototype. It provides a comprehensive review of the current landscape of smart helmet technology, examining both technical advancements and market dynamics. The research identifies key limitations of traditional helmets, such as the lack of proactive safety measures, and explores the integration of state-of-the-art technologies to overcome these challenges. The prototype leverages an array of sensors and connectivity features to enhance user safety and experience. For instance, health monitoring systems embedded within the helmet can track vital signs like heart rate, body temperature, and even fatigue levels. Accident detection mechanisms, powered by accelerometers and gyroscopes, can detect impacts and trigger emergency alerts, potentially saving lives in critical situations. GPS navigation systems offer seamless route guidance, ensuring users remain informed and connected. Additionally, some prototypes integrate augmented reality (AR) displays, enabling hands-free access to information, enhancing usability, especially in professional environments. A thorough market analysis reveals a growing demand for smart helmets, driven by increasing awareness of workplace safety, advancements in wearable technology, and government regulations mandating improved safety standards. Despite their promise, challenges such as high costs, limited battery life, and user adaptability need to be addressed to achieve widespread adoption. Looking ahead, the future of smart helmets is poised for exponential growth, with the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G connectivity, and edge computing. These innovations will enable predictive analytics for accident prevention, seamless communication in remote areas, and personalized user experiences.

Among them, one of the most interesting and successful examples with a highly positive impact in terms of the quality of urban environments and societal and economical welfare is a system of semi-autonomous connected vehicles, where IoT devices, data centers, and fleets of smart vehicles equipped with communication and computational resources are combined into a heterogeneous and distributed infrastructure, unifying hardware, networks, and software. In order to efficiently provide various services (e.g., patrolling, pickup and delivery, monitoring), these systems typically rely on collecting and broadcasting large amounts of data (e.g., sensor data, GPS traces, or maps), which need to be properly collected and processed in a timely manner. As is well documented in the literature, one of the most effective ways to achieve this purpose, especially in a real-time context, is to adopt a graph model of the data (e.g., to model communication networks, roads, or interactions between vehicles) and to employ suitable graph algorithms to solve properly defined computational problems of interest (e.g., shortest paths or distributed consensus). While research in this context has been extensive from a theoretical perspective, works that have focused on the implementation, deployment, and evaluation of the practical performance of graph algorithms for real-world systems of autonomous vehicles have been much rarer. In this paper, we present a study of this kind. Specifically, we first describe the main features of a real-world information system employing semi-autonomous connected vehicles that is currently being tested in the city of L’Aquila (Italy). Then, we present an overview of the computational challenges arising in the considered application domain and provide a systematic survey of known algorithmic results for one of the most relevant classes of computational problems that have to be addressed in said domain, namely, pickup and delivery problems. Finally, we discuss implementation issues, adopted software tools, and the deployment and testing phases concerning one of the algorithmic components of the mentioned real-world system dedicated to handling a specific problem of the above class, namely, the pickup and delivery multi-vehicle problem with time windows."",,""This work has been partially supported by: (i) project EMERGE: innovation agreement between the Ministry of Economical Development, Abruzzo Region, Radiolabs, Elital, Leonardo, Telespazio, the University of L’Aquila, and the Centre of EXcellence EX-Emerge, funded by the Italian Government under CIPE n. 70/2017 (7 August 2017)";" (ii) Italian National Group for Scientific Computation-Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (GNCS-INdAM)."",Applied Sciences,,,,2024-03-29,2024,2024-03-29,,14,7,2884,All OA";" Gold,Article,""D’Emidio, Mattia"; Delfaraz, Esmaeil; Di Stefano, Gabriele; Frittella, Giannantonio;" Vittoria, Edgardo"",""D’Emidio, Mattia (Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of L’Aquila, 67100 L’Aquila, Italy)"; Delfaraz, Esmaeil (Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of L’Aquila, 67100 L’Aquila, Italy); Di Stefano, Gabriele (Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of L’Aquila, 67100 L’Aquila, Italy); Frittella, Giannantonio (Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of L’Aquila, 67100 L’Aquila, Italy);" Vittoria, Edgardo (Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of L’Aquila, 67100 L’Aquila, Italy)"",""D’Emidio, Mattia (University of L'Aquila)"",""D’Emidio, Mattia (University of L'Aquila)"; Delfaraz, Esmaeil (University of L'Aquila); Di Stefano, Gabriele (University of L'Aquila); Frittella, Giannantonio (University of L'Aquila);" Vittoria, Edgardo (University of L'Aquila)"",4,4,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/7/2884/pdf?version=1711706413,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1170289212,40 Engineering"; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this research, a mathematical modeling approach based on B5G-IoT is employed to assess the impact on teaching efficacy. Through a set of constructed mathematical formulas, the influence of live broadcasting is statistically examined in a number of areas, including network flexibility, interactive delay, audio and visual clarity, and transmission quality, by building a set of mathematical formulas. The experimental design compares live English teaching effects under 4G, 5G, and B5G network conditions, collecting key indicators such as video clarity, audio signal-to-noise ratio, interactive delay, content delivery completeness, and learning concentration. Results demonstrate that in the B5G environment, video quality achieves 4 K resolution using H.266/VVC codecs, the audio signal-to-noise ratio improves to 30 dB through real-time noise cancellation algorithms, and interaction delay is reduced to less than 30 ms by leveraging ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) not only foster efficient teacher-student exchanges and a seamless teaching process but also have consequences for students’ physical states. For instance, the improved visual and auditory quality may reduce the strain on students’ eyes and ears, which in turn could affect their overall physical comfort and ability to maintain focus. Additionally, the reduction in interaction delay might lead to more natural and less fatiguing postural adjustments and muscle movements as students interact with the teaching materials. The enhanced reliability and scalability of the B5G network, ensuring 98% knowledge point delivery completeness, can potentially minimize the physical and mental stress associated with disrupted or incomplete learning experiences. This, in turn, may have a positive impact on students’ concentration and active participation in the classroom. By comprehensively considering these aspects, this detailed exploration of B5G and IoT technology applications and implementations offers a more profound understanding of their role in enhancing live English teaching and the associated physical and physiological aspects of student learning."",,,Molecular & Cellular Biomechanics,,,,2025-02-21,2025,2025-02-21,,22,3,828,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Zhou, Shali"",""Zhou, Shali ()"",,""Zhou, Shali ()"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.62617/mcb828,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1185848150,40 Engineering"; 4006 Communications Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We analyze $\mathrm{ECIES}$ scheme in the provable security framework. The object of study ($\mathrm{ECIES}$) is an asymmetric (hybrid) authenticated encryption scheme based on the key exchange scheme $\mathsf{KE}$ and AE(AD)-scheme $\mathsf{AE}$. The encryption process consists of two steps: (a) generating ephemeral pair and session secret key $K$ using $\mathsf{KE}$, (b) encrypting the message $m$ under the key $K$ using $\mathsf{AE}$ and sending results to the recipient. We show that the adversarial advantage against $\mathrm{ECIES}$ scheme in the (standard) $\mathsf{LOR-CCA}$ and $\mathsf{INT-CTXT}$ models can be upper bounded by the adversarial advantage against $\mathsf{KE}$ in the $\mathsf{mODH}$ model (Oracle Diffie-Hellman Model with multiple queries) and against $\mathsf{AE}$ in the (standard) $\mathsf{LOR-CCA}$ and $\mathsf{INT-CTXT}$ models respectively. The security in these models implies the following informal properties: (a) the adversary is unable to extract any useful information about plaintext from the given ciphertext (except for its length); (b) if the adversary is given some ephemeral public key (chosen by the honest party), it is unable to form the ciphertext that may be correctly decrypted under this key (for instance, it cannot modify messages formed by honest senders). We point out some differences in our analysis compared to the previous ones: (a) only the confidentiality of the $\mathrm{ECIES}$ scheme was analyzed; integrity of the scheme (either in the $\mathsf{INT-CTXT}$ or $\mathsf{INT-PTXT}$ models) is not considered; (b) the confidentiality model in previous analysis (LOR-CCA-fg/IND-CCA2) allows only one encryption challenge query to the $\mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{enc}}^b$ oracle; generalization to the case of $q_e$ queries to the encryption oracle seems not to be the immediate consequence; however, the possibility to do a number of queries can make a difference in practice;" (c) the analysis given in the previous papers could be slightly more general: it allows any AE(AD)-scheme to be used instead of concrete Encrypt-then-MAC approach. Hence, we show that it is possible to separate key generation step and encryption process in generic $\mathrm{ECIES}$ scheme and study them independently, which allows one to develop more modular security solutions. The scheme can be used as a building block of more involved protocols (e.g., as a part of user anonymous authentication in 5G-AKA protocol)."",,,Математические вопросы криптографии,,,,2024-06,2024,2024-07-19,2024-06,15,2,101-136,Closed,Article,""Tsaregorodtsev, Kirill Denisovich"",""Tsaregorodtsev, Kirill Denisovich (JSC «NPK Kryptonite», Moscow)"",,""Tsaregorodtsev, Kirill Denisovich (JSC «NPK Kryptonite», Moscow)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1173996020,46 Information and Computing Sciences"; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Up until 2020, working from home was the exception rather than the rule"; streaming movies was a secondary distribution method for the big studios as opposed to their primary outlet;" medical appointments would be done face-to-face not via a video call. The way we pay for goods & services is predominantly moving to contactless methods and with various governments pledging to reduce emissions and promote the use of electric vehicles these steps are bringing in an exciting period of expansion for the whole semiconductor ecosystem. All of the activities listed above, plus numerous others, depend on new generations of semiconductors supporting the required infrastructure. Examples of such setups include 5G, server farms, smartchips, and wide-band gap power devices, all of which form the building blocks of the ‘new normal’. Server farms are driving the evolution of high bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions, several memory die stacked together to provide the necessary performance. New techniques of packaging and integration, eg. hybrid bonding, demand further improvements in die quality and cleanliness than is currently obtainable through mechanical singulation techniques. Bonding success needs the step change improvement in die quality and die strength that comes with the motivation behind plasma dicing. The use of plasma etch as a singulation solution is approaching a level of maturity where the prior levels of concern about the exposure of finished die to plasma etch chemistry are much better understood and, for the most part, resolved. For silicon wafers, the etch step is of relative simplicity when compared to the challenges raised in the integration of the process into the backend and assembly flows. Solutions to the needs of providing patterning, in some form, to define the etched regions have been realised with options including both LASER grooving and photolithography steps. More recently, the most significant effort has gone in to establishing material and process regimes that help to ease the adoption of plasma dicing, in particular the management of fluorine. Managing the consequences of using a fluorinated chemistry is an area where a lot of attention and effort has been necessary. The Bosch process method for deep, anisotropic etching of silicon uses repeated loops of fluorinated gases to create a protective CFx polymer coating on the structure sidewall and then to conduct isotropic etch steps. As plasma dicing is effectively a deep trench etch, this process method is ideal. At the end of the dicing etch, the sidewalls of the die may retain a thin patina of the generated CFx polymer and there is also going to be remnants of the etch chemistry on the die surface. The vast majority of die will have either bond pads or bumps on the top surface, ready for whatever interconnect step follows. In the case of Al bond pads, the surface reaction that occurs when F is present, causes corrosion in the form of AlxFyOz compounds. These compounds impede the successful application of the subsequent wire bond, leading to yield loss or premature failure in service of the finished device. Initially observed after etching operations in the final stages of the front-end manufacturing flow, these phenomena are now well characterised and countered through effective fluorine cleaning processes such as argon sputtering. However, the addition of a fluorine-based dicing process at the start of the backend and assembly flow leads to the risk of reproducing these effects before the bonding steps. Whilst similar cleaning methods could be implemented here, preventative solutions are also available and preferred to simplify the integration of the technology. For the various solder bump materials, there is a similar risk of F compounds affecting the wettability and strength of the final solder joints. However, for these materials, there is also a school of thought that considers F to be a positive addition. Regardless of the possible impact of fluorine in this configuration, there are fewer well-characterised methods available for robust reliability assessment, especially where the final interconnection assembly is completed after sale and delivery of the finished device. Consequently, the understanding of fluorine contamination control obtained through the study of the wire bonding case is of special relevance here. The sidewall polymer, in its ‘non-stick’, Teflon-like form, can cause problems if there is bonding of any sort to take place. This could be the bonding of two die together, side by side, or the placement of the die into an adhesive. In any of the cases, described above, without solutions there is the real risk that broad adoption of plasma dicing would be severely limited. Covering the various mechanisms by which the F residues can form on the die during the plasma dicing process, this paper will discuss the resulting outcomes of the various schemes that have been trialled to deal with them. These developed methodologies have been applied in an aim to prevent, or reduce, the effects of the F residues. Data from critical die testing regimes will be presented showing the impact of these methods on wire bond strength, as measured, for example, by ball shear testing after thermal and humidity treatment, and electrical characterisation of finished, packaged devices following exposure to a series of accelerated ageing conditions."",,,IMAPSource Proceedings,,,,2024-04-10,2024,2024-04-10,,2021,DPC,,Closed,Article,""Hopkins, Janet"; Parker, David;" Barnett, Richard"",""Hopkins, Janet (SPTS Technologies)"; Parker, David (STMicroelectronics);" Barnett, Richard (SPTS Technologies)"",,""Hopkins, Janet (SPTS Technologies)"; Parker, David (STMicroelectronics (Switzerland));" Barnett, Richard (SPTS Technologies)"",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1184276554,40 Engineering"; 4008 Electrical Engineering,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because most data are generated in indoor environments, an ultra-dense deployment of small cells (SCs), particularly within multistory buildings in urban areas, is revealed as an effective technique to improve SE and EE by numerous studies. In this paper, we present a framework exploiting the four most interconnected-domain, including, power, time, frequency, and space, in the perspectives of SE and EE. Unlike existing literature, the framework takes advantage of higher degrees of freedom to maximize SE and EE using in-building SCs for 5G and beyond mobile networks. We derive average capacity, SE, and EE metrics, along with defining the condition for optimality of SE and EE and developing an algorithm for the framework. An extensive system-level evaluation is performed to show the impact of each domain on SE and EE. It is shown that employing multiband enabled SC base stations (SBSs) to increase operating spectrum in frequency-domain, reusing spectrum to SBSs more than once per building in spatial-domain, switching on and off each in-building SBS based on traffic availability to reduce SBS power consumption in power-domain, and using eICIC to avoid co-channel interference due to sharing spectrum with SBSs in time-domain can achieve massive SE and EE. Finally, we show that the proposed framework can satisfy SE, EE, as well as user experience data rate requirements for 5G and beyond mobile networks."",""This paper is partly submitted at the 2020 Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE PIMRC 2020), London, UK [73]."",This research received no external funding.,Sensors,,,,2020-03-17,2020,2020-03-17,,20,6,1676,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The contradiction between the complexity of the scene model and the real-time interaction is the main problem in the operation of the virtual reality system. The model optimization strategy of architectural scene in virtual reality design is studied, and the method of architectural scene model optimization is summarized. This article aims to study the optimization of computer vision software modeling through 5G virtual reality technology. In this paper, the optimization of the architectural model is studied by the method of image gray scale transformation, computer vision detection technology and virtual modeling technology. The four experiments are comprehensive evaluation and quantitative evaluation, comparison of channel estimation performance of different pilot structures, comparison of calculated and true values of external azimuth elements, and the effect of window-to-wall ratio on energy consumption per unit of residential building. The results show that hollow bricks of building materials have a great impact on the environment.

This goal is to be realized, among others, by means of the fifth generation (5G) radio-communication networks. This work presents the assumptions of the 5G network structure and estimates of the level of population exposure toelectromagnetic fields related to their rational use. It was also analyzed whether, from the technical point of view, 5G networks could be implemented while respecting the currently acceptable level of electromagnetic field intensity in Poland (7 V/m), taking into account the current environmental exposure caused by antennas of cellular base stations. This is a contribution to the ongoing discussion on the need to change the requirements in Poland in order to limit the level of population exposure to electromagnetic fields. Based on the available documentation of the proposed technical standards, the theoretical analysis of environmental exposure to the electromagnetic field emitted by 5G systems shows that, with rational power management, obtaining the expected (compatible with 5G standards) quality of connections via base stations installed outside of buildings and using intelligent antenna systems with controlled beams, it will be possible to maintain the electric field strength and power density below the current limit values in places accessible to the public (<7 V/m, <0.1 W/m2).

One cost-effective and time-saving strategy for indoor (B)5G RAN is to reuse the legacy multimode fibers (MMF) deployed in buildings and premises worldwide. In this work, we introduce the concept of indoor (B)5G fronthaul over legacy MMF based on analog-to-digital-compression (ADX), termed as ADX-RoMMF. Enabled by ADX for MIMO data compression, both high radio signal fidelity and fronthaul bandwidth efficiency can be achieved, which alleviates the limitation of low MMF bandwidth-distance product and supports decent indoor coverage. Meanwhile, its digital nature is highly compatible with low-cost optical transceivers (with nonlinearity and/or imperfection) and packet-based fronthaul networking such as time-sensitive networking. Furthermore, the ultralow latency of ADX processing meets the requirement of low-delay (B)5G fronthauling. We experimentally demonstrate an ADX-RoMMF link serving 16-channel MIMO signals with NR-class bandwidth and 1024QAM, leveraging a real-time ADX prototyped on a single-chip field-programmable radio platform. Results show that this 32Gb/s CPRI-equivalent rate can be transported over MMF distance of 850m within 1024QAM EVM requirement, which is 4-fold larger than that of conventional fronthaul compression scheme. Moreover, 500ns ADX latency overhead is also verified."",,,Optics Express,,,,2021-01-12,2021,2021-01-12,2021-01-18,29,2,1945-1955,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Concerns about safety and health hazards resulting from the influence of the electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by the designed 5G antennas have been raised. In Poland, the level of the population's exposure to EMF is limited to 7 V/m for frequencies above 300 MHz. This limitation results from taking into account the protective measures related not only to direct thermal hazards, but also to diversified indirect and long-term threats. Many countries have not established legal requirements in this frequency range, or they have introduced regulations based on recommendations regarding protection against direct thermal risks only (Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC). For such protection, the permissible levels of electric field intensity are 20-60 V/m (depending on the frequency).

To access the countrywide spectrum, each MNO is considered by paying a licensing fee following its number of subscribers. We present the 3D clustering of in-building of small cells and derive average capacity, spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE). We then perform extensive numerical and simulation results and analyses for an MNO of a country consisting of four MNOs. It is shown that, for no spectrum reuse to in-building small cells, the proposed technique improves average capacity and SE by 3.63 and 2.42 times, respectively, whereas EE improves by 72.79%.

Lack of appropriate, unified design approaches is a serious bottleneck for the development of Butler structures for contemporary applications. In this work, a low-cost bottom-up procedure for rigorous and unattended design of miniaturized 4 × 4 Butler matrices is proposed. The presented approach exploits numerical algorithms (governed by a set of suitable objective functions) to control synthesis, implementation, optimization, and fine-tuning of the structure and its individual building blocks. The framework is demonstrated using two miniaturized matrices with nonstandard output-port phase differences. Numerical results indicate that the computational cost of the design process using the presented framework is over 80% lower compared to the conventional approach. The footprints of optimized matrices are only 696 and 767 mm2, respectively. Small size and operation frequency of around 2.6 GHz make the circuits of potential use for mobile devices dedicated to work within a sub-6 GHz 5G spectrum.

However, there is a gap between the precision and accuracy of indoor navigation services provided by indoor navigation service and the expectation of the public. This study proposed a method for constructing a hybrid dual frequency received signal strength indicator (HDRF-RSSI) fingerprint library, which is different from the traditional RSSI fingerprint library constructing method in indoor space using 2.4G radio frequency (RF) under the same Wi-Fi infrastructure condition. The proposed method combined 2.4G RF and 5G RF on the same access point (AP) device to construct a HDRF-RSSI fingerprint library, thereby doubling the fingerprint dimension of each reference point (RP). Experimental results show that the feature discriminability of HDRF-RSSI fingerprinting is 18.1% higher than 2.4G RF RSSI fingerprinting. Moreover, the hybrid radio frequency fingerprinting model, training loss function, and location evaluation algorithm based on the machine learning method were designed, so as to avoid limitation that transmission point (TP) and AP must be visible in the positioning method. In order to verify the effect of the proposed HDRF-RSSI fingerprint library construction method and the location evaluation algorithm, dual RF RSSI fingerprint data was collected to construct a fingerprint library in the experimental scene, which was trained using the proposed method. Several comparative experiments were designed to compare the positioning performance indicators such as precision and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the existing machine learning method based on Wi-Fi 2.4G RF RSSI fingerprint, the machine learning method combining Wi-Fi 5G RF RSSI vector and the original 2.4G RF RSSI vector can effectively improve the precision and accuracy of indoor positioning of the smart phone."",Thanks to the Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Biometrics New Technology for supporting this project.,""This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 61471181";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By exploiting secondary spectrum trading, the proposed DESA method shares partly and exclusively the licensed mmWave spectrum of one MNO to another in a dynamic and on-demand basis for a certain agreement term. We formulate the proposed DESA method for an arbitrary number of MNOs in a country. We then present an iterative algorithm to find the optimal amount of shared spectrum for each MNO, which is updated at each agreement term. We derive average capacity, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency performance metrics for all MNOs countrywide and present extensive numerical and simulation results and analyses for an example scenario of a country with four MNOs each assigned statically with an equal amount of 28-GHz mmWave spectrum. By applying DESA, we show that MNOs with a lack of minimum licensed spectra to serve their data traffic can lease at the cost of payment of the required additional spectra from other MNOs having unused or under-utilized licensed spectra. Moreover, it is shown that the overall countrywide average capacity, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency can be improved, respectively, by 25%, 25%, 17.5%, and 20%. Furthermore, we show that, by applying DESA to all MNOs countrywide, the expected spectral efficiency and energy efficiency requirements for sixth-generation (6G) mobile systems can be achieved by reusing the same mmWave spectrum to 20% fewer buildings of small cells.

In a general sense, the radio frequency (RF) energy that received by wireless mobile phone from the base station, will emit to surrounding when the devices are in active mode. Since the latest fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks is upon us, the emission of radiation from any wireless devices needs to be taken into consideration. This motivation helps to prepare this paper that focuses on construction of novel and compact square-shaped metamaterial (SM) design to reduce electromagnetic exposure to humans. The commercially available substrate material known as FR-4 with thickness of 1.6 mm was selected to place the metamaterial design on it. The electromagnetic properties and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) analyses were carried out numerically by utilising high-performance 3D EM analysis, Computer Simulation Technology Studio (CST) software. Meanwhile, for the validation purpose, the metamaterial designs for both unit and array cells were fabricated to measure the electromagnetic properties of the material. From the numerical simulation, the introduced SM design manifested quadruple resonance frequencies in multi bands precisely at 1.246 (at L-band), 3.052, 3.794 (at S-band), and 4.858 (C-band) GHz. However, the comparison of numerically simulated and measured data reveals a slight difference between them where only the second resonance frequency was decreased by 0.009 GHz while other frequencies were increased by 0.002, 0.045, and 0.117 GHz in sequential order. Moreover, the SAR analysis recorded high values at 3.794 GHz with 61.16% and 70.33% for 1 g and 10 g of tissue volumes, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrate strong SAR reduction effects, and the proposed SM design may be considered a promising aspect in the telecommunication field."",""This work was supported by Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS), MOE, Malaysia, Code: FRGS/1/2018/TK04/UKM/02/13."",,Scientific Reports,,,,2021-01-29,2021,2021-01-29,,11,1,2619,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, an analysis is performed on the supply and demand relationship between suppliers and manufacturers in the supply chain environment and the production mode of intelligent plant based on cloud manufacturing. It is found that the efficient management of spare parts inventory can effectively reduce costs and improve service levels. On this basis, different prediction methods are proposed for different data types of spare parts demand, which are all verified. Finally, the inventory management system based on cloud-edge collaborative computing is constructed, and the genetic algorithm is selected as a comparison to validate the performance of the system reported here. The experimental results indicate that prediction method based on weighted summation of eigenvalues and fitting proposed here has the smallest error and the best fitting effect in the demand prediction of machine spare parts, and the minimum error after fitting is only 2.2%.

Service composition is an essential issue as well as an important technique in cloud manufacturing (CMfg) that supports construction of larger-granularity, value-added services by combining a number of smaller-granularity services to satisfy consumers’ complex requirements. Meta-heuristics algorithms such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and ant colony algorithm are frequently employed for addressing service composition issues in cloud manufacturing. These algorithms, however, require complex design flows and painstaking parameter tuning, and lack adaptability to dynamic environment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides an alternative approach for solving cloud manufacturing service composition (CMfg-SC) issues. DRL as model-free artificial intelligent methods enables a system to learn optimal service composition solutions through training, which can therefore circumvent the aforementioned problems with meta-heuristics algorithms. This paper is dedicated to exploring possible applications of DRL in CMfg-SC. A logistics-involved QoS-aware DRL-based CMfg-SC is proposed. A dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized replay named PD-DQN is designed as the DRL algorithm. Effectiveness, robustness, adaptability, and scalability of PD-DQN are investigated, and compared with that of the basic DQN and Q-learning.

However, ultra-densely deployed BSs are associated with extremely high construction and operation costs for 5G cellular networks. Reducing the construction cost and decreasing the energy consumption of BSs under the premise of ensuring the quality and coverage of services have become major challenges for the rollout of 5G technology. Essentially, the location optimization of 5G BSs can be regarded as a type of maximum coverage location problem (MCLP). Hence, this study coupled geographic information system (GIS) and a heuristic optimization algorithm to spatially explicit simulate the propagation of 5G signals and to optimize the service coverage of 5G BSs. The developed model was applied to search for the optimal solutions in 5G cellular network planning for an urban outdoor area in Wuhan, China.

This is done in different interesting 5G areas with a variety of radio conditions such as an indoor office building lobby, an outdoor parking area, and a realistic urban deployment of a 5G radio access system with BSs installed in buildings to deploy a 5G trial area in the Tokyo Odaiba waterfront area. Experimental results show that throughput exceeding 10Gbps is achieved in a 730MHz bandwidth using 8 component carriers, and distributed MIMO throughput gain is achieved in various transmission point deployments in the indoor office building lobby and outdoor parking area using two radio units (RUs). In particular, in the outdoor parking area, a distinct advantage from distributed MIMO is expected and the distributed MIMO gain in throughput of 60% is achieved. The experimental results also clarify the downlink performance in an urban deployment. The experimental results show that throughput exceeding 1.5Gbps is achieved in the area and approximately 200 Mbps is achieved at 500m away from the BS. We also confirm that the beam tracking and intra-BBU HO work well compensating for high path loss at 28-GHz, and achieve coverage 500m from the BS. On the other hand, line of sight (LoS) and non-line-of sight (N-LoS) conditions are critical to 5G performance in the 28-GHz band, and we observe that 5G connections are sometimes dropped behind trees, buildings, and under footbridges."",,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,2019-08-01,2019,2019-08-01,2019-08-01,E102.B,8,1427-1436,Closed,Article,""KURITA, Daisuke";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In order to build a stable innovative service composition, we propose a novel composite model, which uses two-way selection according to their cooperation to recommend the most suitable partners. Firstly, a rough number is applied to quantify the semantic evaluation. Using the expectation of cooperative condition as reference points, prospect theory is then applied to calculate the cooperative desires for both sides based on participants’ psychological attitudes toward gains and losses. Next, the cooperative desires are used to establish the two-way selection model of innovative service composition. The solution is determined by using an improved teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm. Compared with traditional combined methods in the cloud manufacturing environment, the proposed model fully considers the long-neglected needs and interests of service providers. Prospect theory takes psychological expectations and varying attitudes of decision makers towards gains and losses into account. Moreover, an interval rough number is used to better preserve the uncertain information during semantic quantification.

The 4IR focusing on the construction industry in literature is known as Construction 4.0. The Construction 4.0 concept is invoked to transform the current ways the construction industry operates while ensuring benefits, such as reduced overall construction projects’ costs and duration, improved quality and work safety, etc. Due to the increasing web usage, it is anticipated that the 4IR technologies will achieve full potentials by the uprising of the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks (i.e. 5G). One of the most important 4IR technologies is found to be the Internet of Things (IoT). In this perspective, a construction monitoring approach, more precisely a model for construction detection and object spatial/time positioning, is presented in this paper. While still in its initial phase, the model was tested and verified in the laboratory environment for small-scale object detection.

Expediting 5G wireless service can benefit consumers and businesses at the risk of stressing the traditional process of spectrum planning that combines study, dialogue and consensus building at ITU conferences. This paper explains why most nations refused to endorse key United States 5G spectrum allocation proposals at the ITU’s, 2015 World Radio Conference. U.S. representatives underestimated the time needed for consensus building, despite increasing demand for wireless video and the evolving Internet of Things. Other contributing factors include U.S. support for treating spectrum like property, use of “incentive auctions” to clear broadcast television spectrum with unprecedented speed and enough existing wireless spectrum allocations in most nations.

The project Level 5 Indoor Navigation (L5IN) presents a new approach with mobile phone standard 5G as the orientation signal and without additional infrastructure for navigation in indoor environments. The aim of this project is to use the new available 5G technology to show how navigation systems, which have thus far only been available in the outdoor segment, can now be integrated into existing smartphone systems for indoor navigation. This paper gives an overview of the project and presents the different work packages leading to a holistic approach towards the development of an indoor navigation application for pedestrians. By using a specific app with open interfaces, it is planned to make navigation possible in all buildings modeled according to certain standards. The challenge involved is that, unlike outdoor maps, there is no map basis for buildings. For this reason, different approaches to map generation were examined. In a building information model (BIM), all information will be collected and made available via a database for positioning and visualization. The focus is furthermore on positioning, achieved through smartphone sensors and 5G, so that users can orientate themselves in buildings without having to connect to singular systems. It shall be shown that positioning with a standard deviation of 2–3 m and a confidence interval of 68 % is possible. Another advantage of 5G, the ability to send real-time data in higher data packages, will be used for data transmission.

"                  The next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks and mobile communications (5G IoT networks) has the particularity of being heterogeneous, therefore, it has very strong ability to compute, store, etc. Group-oriented applications demonstrate its potential ability in 5G IoT networks. One of the main challenges for secure group-oriented applications (SGA) in 5G IoT networks is how to secure communication and computation among these heterogeneous devices. Conventional protocols are not suitable for SGA in 5G IoT networks since multiparty joint computation in this environment requires lightweight communication and computation overhead. Furthermore, the primary task of SGA is to securely transmit various types of jointly computing data. Hence, membership authentication and secure multiparty joint arithmetic computation become two fundamental security services in SGA for 5G IoT networks. The membership authentication allows communication entities to authenticate their communication partners and the multiparty joint computations allow a secret output to be shared among all communication entities. The multiparty joint computation result can be used to protect exchange information in the communication or be used as a result that all users jointly compute by using their secret inputs. A novel construction of computation/communications-efficient membership authenticated joint arithmetic computation is proposed in this paper for 5G IoT networks, which not only integrates the function of membership authentication and joint arithmetic computation but also realizes both computation and communication efficiency on each group member side. Our protocol is secure against inside attackers and outside attackers, and also meets all the described security goals. Meanwhile, in this construction the privacy of tokens can be well protected so tokens can be reused multiple times. This proposal is noninteractive and can be easily extended to joint arithmetic computation with any number of inputs. Hence, our design has more attraction for lightweight membership authenticated joint arithmetic computation in 5G IoT networks."",""The data underlying this article are available in the article and in its online supplementary material.

To provide robust traffic services, knowledge of the multipath propagation characteristics is required in the design and evaluation of mmWave 5G systems. In this paper, we investigate the multipath dispersion characteristics of O2I propagation in the angular and delay domains. This study is based on field measurement data conducted at 32 GHz in two different office building sites: traditional building and thermally-efficient building. To derive reliable statistics, we collected measurement data at as many points as possible throughout the building areas (including various environments such as open-space offices, conference rooms, classical closed-room offices, computer labs, halls, corridors, etc). By analyzing power angular and power delay profiles, we found that there were two dominant signal directions and we considered how this property can be utilized in mmWave beamforming. By comparing the angular and delay spreads, we found that the angular and delay statistics do not show any significant differences between the two building measurements.

The 5G-based IoT security analysis is crucial to IoT Technology, which will eventually expand extensively into massive machine-type communications and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications. This paper analyses the countermeasures and verification methods of eavesdropping vulnerabilities within IoT devices that use the current 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) network system. The network hierarchical structure of 5G-based IoT was evaluated for vulnerability analysis, performed separately for 5G Access Stratum (AS), Non-Access Stratum (NAS), and Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). AS keystream reuse, NAS null-ciphering, and IMS IPsec off vulnerabilities were tested on mobile carrier networks to validate it on the 5G NSA network as well.

However, the detection speed of traditional deep learning models is slow, and the low‐latency characteristics of 5G networks cannot be fully utilized. In order to improve the safety perception ability based on 5G‐V2X, increase the detection speed in vehicle perception. A vehicle perception model is proposed. First, an adaptive feature extraction method is adopted to enhance the expression of small‐scale features and improve the feature extraction ability of small‐scale targets. Then, by improving the feature fusion method, the shallow information is fused layer by layer to solve the problem of feature loss. Finally, the attention enhancement method is introduced to increase the center point prediction ability and solve the problem of target occlusion. The experimental results show that the UA‐DETRAC data set has a good detection effect. Compared with the vehicle detection capability before the improvement, the detection accuracy and speed have been greatly improved, which effectively improves the security perception capability based on the 5G‐V2X system, thereby promoting the construction of smart cities."",""Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Amongst all fire safety studies, evacuation in tall buildings, including elevator evacuations, has attracted much attention. IoT-aided building fire evacuation is a new concept of the building evacuation mode, which improves the building evacuation process by making decisions of escape based on the real-time fire-ground information, such as the fire environment and occupant situations. Focusing on IoT applications in building fire evacuation, this paper explores the advantages and insufficiencies of current smart building fire evacuation systems.

At a time when 5G commercialization is incipient, it is necessary to understand mobile communication service users who are likely to be important initial users for the creation and diffusion of 5G services. The current study analyzed consumer preference for 5G services based on conjoint survey data and a mixed logit model, and we conducted a market simulation based on the estimation results to determine the impact of 5G technology development on the 5G market, specifically regarding the mobile communication fields. In addition, this study derived consumer purchase delay factors for 5G services using an ordered logit model. The results show that consumers delay the adoption of 5G services mainly because of the cost and lack of need.

We show that the bit indices within each component polar code can follow a fixed, precomputed ranking sequence (e.g., the Polar sequence in the 5G standard) while their allocated rates (i.e., the number of information bits of each component polar code) can be fast computed by exploiting the target sum-rate approximation and proper rate-filling methods. In particular, we propose two rate-filling methods based on the capacity and the rate considering the finite blocklength effect. The proposed construction methods can be performed independently of the actual channel condition with ${O(m)}$ (${m}$ denotes the modulation order) complexity and robust to diverse modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) in the 5G standard, which is a desired feature for practical systems."",This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62001049 and Grant 92067202";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These formats result however in a PRACH capacity shortfall where the number of sequences available for network planning may just be enough to support few cells without sequence reuse. To overcome this issue, two enlarged constant-amplitude sequence constructions that include ZC sequences, and thus being backward-compatible with the current 5G PRACH design, are presented. Both constructions feature a desirable subset structure from which follows a natural cellular network sequence allocation where each cell-specific sequence subset has a controllable low-correlation zone similar to ZC sequences, and thus enables a similar detection performance inside a cell. The two extensions are meanwhile structurally different and offer different network allocations, as for one, new sequences are distributed among all cells, while for the other, they are in separated cells. With both proposed supersets and the new 5G PRACH formats, hundred-times more cells without sequence reuse can be supported compared to ZC sequences for a moderately larger inter-cell correlation than intra-cell correlation. Simulation results confirm that using the proposed supersets instead of reusing sequences in the network can significantly improve detection performance."",,,IEEE Transactions on Communications,,,,2020-06-19,2020,2020-06-19,2020-09-01,68,9,5673-5688,Closed,Article,""Pitaval, Renaud-Alexandre";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Consequently, secure techniques for data transmissions will be needed as the basis for 5G-IoT technology to address these arising challenges. Therefore, various traditional security mechanisms are provided for 5G-IoT technologies and most of them are built on mathematical foundations. With the growth of quantum technologies, traditional cryptographic techniques may be compromised due to their mathematical computation based construction. Quantum walks (QWs) is a universal quantum computational model, which possesses inherent cryptographic features that can be utilized to build efficient cryptographic mechanisms. In this paper, we use the features of quantum walk to construct a new S-box method which plays a significant role in block cipher techniques for 5G-IoT technologies. As an application of the presented S-box mechanism and controlled alternate quantum walks (CAQWs) for 5G-IoT technologies a new robust video encryption mechanism is proposed.

To integrate renewable energy economically in buildings and smart cities an additional concept of energy storage and energy supply based on energy management concepts must be claimed. The political views have changed during the last years and energy efficiency in buildings is seen important because 35% of greenhouse gas is produced by the final energy consumption. The deployment of local energy production concepts is an important step to energy turnaround. To generate and distribute energy effectively in buildings, digital components such as sensors, actuators, meters, and energy management systems must be installed in the buildings and the digital components must be able to communicate via communication networks.

Methods  This study was conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from October 2017 to April 2019. Based on the latest requirements of emergency medical services at home and abroad, the cross-enterprise and multi-disciplinary technical forces were organized to build platform. Firstly, to determine the process of pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medical services, various modules and technical routes were constructed under 5G conditions and individual technologies were tested one by one.

By exploiting the high external wall penetration loss of a building, the iSMS spectrum is shared with small cells per building in OSS, and small cells per 3-dimensional (3D) cluster per building in nOSS. An interference management scheme, to avoid interference in apartments with collocated CGC stations and small cells, was developed and an optimal number of almost blank subframes (ABSs) per ABS pattern period (APP) was defined. System-level capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency performance metrics were derived. Furthermore, we present an algorithm for both OSS and nOSS techniques. With extensive simulation and numerical analysis, it is shown that the proposed nOSS significantly outperforms OSS in terms of spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, and both techniques can meet the expected spectral efficiency and energy efficiency requirements for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks."",""This paper was presented partly at the 2019 Joint Conference on Satellite Communications (JC SAT 2019), JR Hakata City, Fukuoka, Japan, 10–11 October 2019 [22].

In these scenes, the volume of data transmission is quite large, especially visual data (image, video, et al). However, due to the limited resource of IoT devices, such as battery, power, bandwidth, visual data transmission is complex to optimize, single objective optimization is difficult to insure the optimal latency, throughput and power at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method to jointly optimize the resource allocation of visual data transmission in resource constraint 5G IoT. Instead of single objective optimization, we combine the bandwidth, power consumption and latency into a hybrid model, then propose a low-complexity algorithm to solve this multiple objective optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method increases the comprehensive utility of visual data transmission in the resource constraint 5G-IoT by 35%-48% compared with existing approaches."",,,E3S Web of Conferences,,""P.

This evolution of communication will not only improve the performance of the existing networks, but will also enable various applications in other fields while integrating different heterogeneous systems. This massive scaling of mobile communication requires higher bandwidth to operate. 5G promises a robust solution by offering ultra-low latency and high bandwidth for data transmission. To provide individuals and companies with a real-time, social, and all connected experience, an end-to-end coordinated architecture which is agile and intelligent has to be designed at each stage. As FPGA has the potential to be resource/power efficient, it can be used for building up constituents of 5G infrastructure.

In each network slice, service-required virtual network functions (VNFs) can be flexibly deployed in an on-demand manner, which will support a variety of 5G use cases. However, due to the real-time network variations and diverse performance requirements among different 5G scenarios, online adaptive VNF deployment and migration are needed to dynamically accommodate to service-specific requirements. In this paper, we first propose a time-slot based 5G network slice model, which jointly includes both edge cloud servers and core cloud servers. Since VNF consolidation may cause severe performance degradation, we adopt a demand-supply model to quantify the VNF interference. To achieve our objective—maximizing the total reward of accepted requests (i.e., the total throughput minus the weighted total VNF migration cost), we propose an Online Lazy-migration Adaptive Interference-aware Algorithm (OLAIA) for real-time VNF deployment and cost-efficient VNF migration in a 5G network slice, where an Adaptive Interference-aware Algorithm (AIA) is proposed as OLAIA’s core function for placing a given set of requests’ VNFs with maximized total throughput. Through trace-driven evaluations on two typical 5G network slices, we demonstrate that OLAIA can efficiently handle the real-time network variations and the VNF interference when deploying VNFs for real-time arriving requests. In particular, OLAIA improves the total reward by 22.18% in the autonomous driving scenario and by 51.10% in the 4K/8K HD video scenario, as compared with other state-of-the-art solutions."",""This work was supported in part by the NSFC through the NSFC-Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under Grant 61722206, Grant 61761136014, Grant 392046569, and Grant 61520106005";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The considered FDSS concept is shown to have large potential for reducing the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of the signal, which directly impacts the feasible maximum transmit power under practical nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) while still meeting the radio frequency (RF) emission requirements imposed by the regulations. To this end, the FDSS scheme with spectral extension is formulated, defining filter windows that fit to the 5G NR spectral flatness requirements. The PAPR reduction capabilities and the corresponding maximum achievable transmit powers are evaluated for a variety of bandwidth allocations in the supported 5G NR frequency ranges 1 and 2 (FR1 and FR2) and compared to those of the currently supported waveforms in 5G NR, particularly $\pi /2$ -BPSK with FDSS without spectral extension and QPSK without FDSS. Furthermore, an efficient receiver structure capable of reducing the noise enhancement in the equalization phase is proposed. Finally, by evaluating the link-level performance, together with the transmit power gain, the overall coverage enhancement gains of the method are analyzed and provided. The obtained results show that the spectrally-extended FDSS method is a very efficient solution to improve the 5G NR UL coverage clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art, while being also simple in terms of computational complexity such that the method is implementation feasible in practical 5G NR terminals."",This work was supported in part by the Academy of Finland under Grant 319994 and Grant 332361";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Probabilistic forecasting of the impact of electromagnetic fields of radio frequencies on the population (literature review),""Introduction. The Russian telecommunications industry is on the threshold of introducing 5G/IMT-2020 (5G) mobile communications. The expected technological innovations of the new generation standard will lead to an increase in the capacity of mobile operators ‘ networks, data transfer speeds, the emergence of new scenarios for the use of mobile communications and the development of innovative digital services.

The information base of the research was Russian strategic documents on the development of 5G technologies, articles published in domestic and foreign journals. Results. The primary input data for the construction of 5G networks are presented, allowing us to evaluate EMO and identify the new technology features that are significant in terms of the impact of RF electromagnetic fields on the population. The 5G network uses previously unused RF bands and new types of antennas. With the introduction of 5G, the density of base stations (BS) and access points will significantly increase, the heights of BS antennas will decrease, and the spatial and temporal characteristics of electromagnetic radiation will change substantially. Conclusion. The architecture of the 5G network differs significantly from the mobile communication standards of previous generations. The introduction of 5G networks will lead to a significant change in the electromagnetic background in the environment.

New local 5G network operator models, such as the recently introduced micro-operators, are increasingly important for vertical specific service delivery. The emergence of 5G micro-operator networks in spatially confined areas depends on local spectrum availability. In this paper, we investigate the performance of local 5G indoor micro-operator networks in the 3.6-GHz and 26-GHz bands. We consider two uncoordinated time-division duplex networks in adjacent buildings sharing the same channel with different base station antenna configurations and deployment densities. We evaluate the resulting performance of the victim network via system simulations. We have observed that the center frequency does not significantly impact the downlink performance unless the network is noise-limited. However, the uplink performance in 26-GHz band is affected by higher coupling losses between the base stations and mobile terminals. Our results indicate that beamforming and wider bandwidths help to improve the performance in 26-GHz band. More importantly, two indoor micro-operators can successfully coexist with a very small separation distance in the 26-GHz band, while in the 3.6-GHz band, a considerably larger isolation between the networks is required, for example, in the form of a much larger separation distance."",This research has been financially supported by Business Finland in uO5G project and Academy of Finland in 6Genesis Flagship (grant 318927).

With more capability and complex machinery, the requirements for sensing in larger factories are critical, considering the data amount, latency, and the number of sensors in operation. Given the excellent time-critical operation, bandwidth and the number of devices connected, the 5G indoor femtocells could prove an excellent option for building industrial sensor grids. For more flexibility in control and reliability, operating the 5G indoor femtocell network in license-free frequency bands could be an alternative to commercial 5G services. The 5G networks incorporate a very dense network of indoor femtocells. The Femtocells also enhance data rates, indoor performance, and coverage area both in residential and industrial environments. Therefore, keeping in view the above-stated actualities, this paper addresses different indoor scenarios for radio wave propagation and simulates several path loss models to calculate the likely and most suitable propagation model for indoor signaling. Multiple models for frequencies in the unlicensed band below 6 GHz and above 6 GHz (licensed) 5G femtocells are discussed in the paper considering the constraints of material types, attenuation due to obstacles, various floors, carrier frequency, and distance from the transmitter. The comparative analysis indicates that the ITU model and Keenan–Motley model give the highest path loss in residential and industrial environments, respectively, while the log-distance model has the lowest path loss in both environments for below 6 GHz frequencies in the unlicensed spectrum. For the above 6 GHz licensed bands, the Alpha Beta Gamma (ABG) model and Path Loss Exponent (CIF) model are observed to have the minimum path loss difference."",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

With the enhancement of 5G NR, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networking can gain more flexibility, reliability, and elasticity to assist residents or workers to finish missions of high complexity and risks remotely. The beamforming of 5G NR can improve the accuracy and the flexibility of connections between the mobile devices. With a high throughput guaranteed in the UAV swarm networking, the remote can deliver specific instructions with the high accuracy of requirement. Further, a reliable and high volume throughput assures multiple UAV swarm networking can exchange information to collaborate and cooperate underneath different mission allocations. In this article, we propose a cell wall paradigm to escalate the flexibility and the throughput for the heterogeneous 5G-enabled UAV swarm networking. With the construction of the cell wall, we formulate and summarize the throughput optimization into the capacity maximal problem to achieve the max–min throughput. Thereafter, we implement an optimal edge coloring solution with the upper bound and the lower bound of color selection to scheduling the orders of active links. Based on the optimal scheduling for each separate networking, we focus on the balance of the inter- and intra-active links to mitigate collisions on the UAVs to strengthen the throughput of UAV swarm networking for the collaboration and corporation of the heterogeneous UAV swarms on a large scale. The evaluation shows the optimal edge coloring approach can improve the throughput for UAV swarm networking at 73.8% maximally.

The ubiquitous implementations of 5G NR cellular networking also provide swarm Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) networking the feasibility of scalable deployment and smart control. However, the conveniences derived from 5G NR also bring other vulnerabilities to swarm UAS networking. The advanced capacities of 5G NR enable attackers to commit disruptive attacks to swarm UAS networking more severely and quickly. The requirement for the security of swarm UAS networking is imminent. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Blockchain-based secure routing algorithm for swarm UAS networking. We leverage the lightweight Blockchain to enhance the security of routing of swarm UAS networking which is based on 5G NR cellular networking. Different from the conventional routing algorithms, the proposed algorithm with lightweight Blockchain can avoid the malicious connections from attackers, recognize the malicious UASs and mitigate the attacks from malicious UASs. Concurrently, the proposed algorithm are swarm UAS oriented which aims to extend the deployment of swarm UAS networking on a large scale. Compared with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake(PoS), we adopt pheromone to estimate the traffic status of each UAS in swarm UAS networking, construct consensus for swarm UAS networking with Proof-of-Traffic (PoT) and synchronize the updated blocks for lightweight Blockchain passively under the constraints of energy consumption. The evaluation shows PoT can reduce the routing consumption in the processes of consensus construction and blocks synchronization.

Adding LEO satellite to the construction of 5G and 6G can make the network structure three‐dimensional, which lets the network construction get rid of the limitation of ground space propagation distance and makes the wider area enjoy the convenience of 5G and 6G. However, due to the large link distance between space and the ground, the communication of LEO satellite in Ka band is greatly affected by rain attenuation and shadow fading. In order to improve the ergodic capacity of LEO satellite downlink, this paper attempts to apply nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to hybrid channels with rainfall fading and shadow fading. In the simulation results, the ergodic capacity of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and NOMA is compared, and it is found that the system capacity of hybrid channel can be improved by increasing the power allocation factor of NOMA. The experiments have studied the influence of LEO satellite's orbital height, fading degree, and transmission power in the communication link on the performance of LEO satellite system in this paper. The experimental results show that the lower the orbit height is, the better system performance will become under the same fading degree. Moreover, the energy consumed gradually decreases with the transmission power becoming small."",This work was supported in part by the Sichuan Provincial Key Research and Development Program under Grant 2021YFQ0011 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61961040 and 61771089.,""Funding information Sichuan Provincial Key Research and Development Program, Grant/Award Number: 2021YFQ0011";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the meantime, various cyber-attacks for IoT have increased and caused huge losses. Lots of security mechanisms are rapidly being proposed to prevent the potentially malicious attackers for IoT, in which machine learning especially deep learning (DL) as increasingly popular solution for security has been implemented in intrusion detection system (IDS) and others. However, the lack of enough datasets prevents the application of IDS in 5G IoT system. As one of fundamental components of IDS, network traffic classification shows a discretization, individualization and fine-grained trend which derives the different personalized classification methods for different requirements and scenarios. In this case, the data-driven DL faces the following challenges. First, there are only a few labeled datasets in the various personalized application scenarios, which undoubtedly limits the deployment of DL classification. Second, not all scenarios have rich computing capability for that training a neural network requires lots of computing resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a traffic classification method based on deep transfer learning for 5G IoT scenarios with scarce labeled data and limited computing capability, and trains the classification model by weight transferring and neural network fine-tuning. Different from the previous work that extract artificially designed features, the proposed method retains the end-to-end learning performance of DL and reduces the risk of suffering conceptdrift to reduce human intervention. Experimental results show that when only 10% of dataset are used to label the data samples, the classification accuracy is close to the results of full training dataset."",""The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which helped them to improve the content, organization, and presentation of this paper."",,International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics,,,,2021-08-19,2021,2021-08-19,2021-11,12,11,3351-3365,Closed,Article,""Guan, Jianfeng";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As part of these studies, we consider the provision of millimeter-wave high-speed communications over a wide area to multiple mobile stations traveling at high speed. In a high-mobility environment, area construction must be performed over a wide area through the cooperation of multiple base stations. Additionally, to achieve simultaneous communications with multiple mobile stations, interference must be suppressed so that signals transmitted to each mobile station do not interfere with each other. To deal with these issues, we developed millimeter-wave base station cooperation technology to enable multiple base stations to cooperate with each other while suppressing inter-mobile-station interference by applying digital beamforming to base stations to generate and control beams by digital signal processing.

As an application example, 5G is used to implement automated shunting at a transshipment station in the city of Ulm in Germany. The contribution is based on the premise that greenhouse gas emissions in rail-bound freight traffic are significantly lower than those in road transport and that therefore framework conditions should be created that make a corresponding shift possible. Based on a quantitative data analysis of road freight traffic based on source-destination traffic in the area of Ulm, a possible traffic reduction and CO2 savings are derived and discussed. Furthermore, possible interactions caused by the construction and operation of the additional 5G infrastructure will be highlighted. The shift potential and systemic effects of automated shunting are described along three what-if scenarios. It is shown that the relevant road freight traffic volume can already be fully covered by the capacities created in scenario 1. With the other scenarios an additional shift potential is created. Digitalization and automation thus take on the role of “enablers” for a switch to rail as a significantly lower-emission mode of transport. The article illustrates that greater leverage effects can be achieved if IT is used not only to increase efficiency, but also for a more extensive system change.

But the low-emissivity (low-E) windows that will be more popular in the future introduce 10 dB higher loss.

Typical approaches include individual or cooperative data regeneration to efficiently utilize the available bandwidth. It is observed that storage systems of 5G and beyond technologies shall have a multi-layer architecture in which base stations (BS) would be present. Moreover, communication with each layer would be subject to various communication costs and link constraints. Under limited BS assistance and cooperation, the trade-off between storage per node and communication bandwidth has been established.

This is due to a number of objective factors in recent years, which are the result of ongoing evolution at the next stage of the transition to 5G networks. If in the networks of previous generations 2G-4G geolocation was an optional service, which developed mainly according to the requirements of emergency services and law enforcement, as well as in scenarios when signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) were unavailable, then for a promising 5G digital ecosystem, network positioning can rightfully be stated as a separate area of research and development. The arguments for this statement are at least two circumstances. First, in recent years, a wide range of geoinformation services has been developed, which are impossible and / or inappropriate to solve exclusively by GNSS systems. It is also indicative that in the latest specifications of the 3GPP partner project, among others, there were explicit requirements for the accuracy and availability of network positioning services, as well as a description of all possible geolocation scenarios with an accuracy of one meter. Secondly, the analysis of foreign sources in recent years has shown that the so-called concept of communication organization based on LAC (Location Aware Communication) positioning data has been developed, according to which location awareness can be used at different levels of the OSI model for improving the efficiency of building and operating radio stations as part of ultra-dense 5G radio access networks. In this paper, positioning scenarios in 5G networks are systematized, as well as probabilistic models and methods for assessing the accuracy of geolocation in relation to the problems of location estimation in 5G networks.

There is an obvious difference in service requirements between different scenarios. When multi-scenario services coexist in the 5G networks, exploring optimized resource scheduling and allocation strategies become a critical issue. The 5G New Radio (NR) and numerology technologies have been standardized, which lay the foundation for flexible frame structure and adaptive scheduling. In this paper, we propose the self-adaptive flexible transmission time interval (TTI) scheduling (SAFE-TS) strategy in the eMBB and uRLLC coexistence scenario. Machine learning (ML) is applied to achieve flexible TTI scheduling. Moreover, we design the random forest-based ensemble TTI decision algorithm (RF-ETDA) to accomplish the TTI selection for each service. Compared with the existing ML methods, the proposed algorithm has a performance improvement in selecting TTI, especially for the uRLLC services. Then, the TTI selection results will be the basis of system resource scheduling and allocation. The simulation results prove that the proposed SAFE-TS effectively reduce the delay and packet loss rate of the uRLLC services while guaranteeing the eMBB requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that flexible TTI scheduling should be applied in the construction of the 5G networks to achieve superior network performances."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871045, the 111 Project of China under Grant B16006, and the NOKIA."",IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-05-20,2019-01-01,7,,65811-65820,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To meet these requirements, the anticipated deployment cost in the United Kingdom (UK) is predicted to be between £30bn and £50bn, whereas the current annual capital expenditure (CapEX) of the mobile network operators (MNOs) is £2.5bn. This prospect has vastly impacted and has become one of the major delaying factors for building the 5G physical infrastructure, whereas other areas of 5G are progressing at their speed. Due to the expensive and complicated nature of the network infrastructure and spectrum, the second-tier operators, widely known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), are entirely dependent on the MNOs. In this paper, an extensive study is conducted to explore the possibilities of reducing the 5G deployment cost and developing viable business models. In this regard, the potential of infrastructure, data, and spectrum sharing is thoroughly investigated. It is established that the use of existing public infrastructure (e.g., streetlights, telephone poles, etc.) has a potential to reduce the anticipated cost by about 40% to 60%. This paper also reviews the recent Ofcom initiatives to release location-based licenses of the 5G-compatible radio spectrum. Our study suggests that simplification of infrastructure and spectrum will encourage the exponential growth of scenario-specific cellular networks (e.g., private networks, community networks, micro-operators) and will potentially disrupt the current business models of telecommunication business stakeholders – specifically MNOs and TowerCos. Furthermore, the anticipated dense device connectivity in 5G will increase the resolution of traditional and non-traditional data availability significantly. This will encourage extensive data harvesting as a business opportunity and function within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as large social networks. Consequently, the rise of new infrastructures and spectrum stakeholders is anticipated. This will fuel the development of a 5G data exchange ecosystem where data transactions are deemed to be high-value business commodities. The privacy and security of such data, as well as definitions of the associated revenue models and ownership, are challenging areas – and these have yet to emerge and mature fully. In this direction, this paper proposes the development of a unified data hub with layered structured privacy and security along with blockchain and encrypted off-chain based ownership/royalty tracking. Also, a data economy-oriented business model is proposed. The study found that with the potential commodification of data and data transactions along with the low-cost physical infrastructure and spectrum, the 5G network will introduce significant disruption in the Telco business ecosystem."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-01-07,2020-01-01,8,,11352-11379,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It extends the scope and depth of resources sharing and enables society-based manufacturing integration. SharedMfg is complex and is still in its infancy. It demands encouraging research to clarify the concept and understand the key operations. In this paper, the SharedMfg is analysed along with two significant manufacturing evolutional trends, (i.e., Servitization and Industry 4.0). Based on this, to reduce the complexities in operations, the concept and definition of SharedMfg are presented on the basis of a service hierarchy that includes Product-Service System, Configuration-Service System and Resource-Service System. At the same time, this paper looks SharedMfg as an independent socialization manufacturing mode (e.g. compared with Cloud Manufacturing), and also, the benefit in contributing to the integration of the manufacturing and service sectors is revealed. However, apart from the complexity, high-degree dynamics and uncertainties related to service operations challenge the application of SharedMfg as well. To meet both requirements, based on the construction of a three-dimensional SharedMfg Service (SMS) modelling framework, a hybrid integration and interoperable SharedMfg architecture is proposed to ensure the provision of SMS in efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, a dynamic SMS scheduling method in support of the technologies of Complex Network Analysis is presented. A case study associated with the networked fabrication of an assistive glove is applied by implementing a prototype system to validate the proposed frameworks and methods.

Smart healthcare networks based on 5G are expected to have heterogeneous energy and mobility, requiring them to adapt to the connected environment. As a result, in 5G-based smart healthcare, building a routing protocol that optimizes energy consumption, reduces transmission delay, and extends network lifetime remains a challenge. This paper presents a clustering-based routing protocol to improve the Quality of services (QoS) and energy optimization in 5G-based smart healthcare. QoS and energy optimization are achieved by selecting an energy-efficient clustering head (CH) with the help of game theory (GT) and best multipath route selection with reinforcement learning (RL). The cluster head selection is modeled as a clustering game with a mixed strategy considering various attributes to find equilibrium conditions. The parameters such as distance between nodes, the distance between nodes and base station, the remaining energy and speed of mobility of the nodes were used for cluster head (CH) selection probability.

With the development of computation capability and future 5G, the ACP theory ( i.e., artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel computing ) will play a much more crucial role in modeling and control of complex systems like commercial and academic buildings. The necessity of making accurate predictions of energy consumption out of a large number of operational parameters has become a crucial problem in smart buildings. Previous attempts have been made to seek energy consumption predictions based on historical data in buildings. However, there are still questions about parallel building consumption prediction mechanism using a large number of operational parameters.

To evaluate the accumulated interference power of numerous 5G systems distributed globally at a satellite receiver, we extend the satellite’s interference reception area to the entire coverage area, from which only the land area is extracted using the geospatial terrain data of Earth in three dimensions. This enables more accurate interference assessment than conventional methods that only consider the footprint of the satellite’s 3-dB beamwidth. We also place the IMT-2020 (5G) systems in the coverage area using the IMT-2020 parameters and modeling documents for the International Telecommunication Union’s coexistence study. The propagation loss is modeled considering the clutter loss, building entry loss, and attenuation from atmospheric gases. Subsequently, we analyze the interference power received by a fixed satellite service (FSS) satellite operating in the same band and an Earth exploration satellite service (EESS) passive sensor operating in an adjacent channel. Our simulation shows that the FSS satellite receives up to 7.9dB more interference than that obtained from the existing method. Although this is a substantial difference, we find that the protection criteria is still satisfied. However, all EESS passive sensors do not meet the protection criteria in most scenarios, and additional frequency separation or interference mitigation techniques are required to protect these sensors.

In this paper, the rate-compatible RL-QC-LDPC coded interleave division multiple access (IDMA), or called the enhanced IDMA, is developed as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based random access solution, and various spectral efficiencies can be flexibly supported thanks to the rate compatible capability. First, 5G-NR LDPC codes are directly incorporated into enhanced IDMA-based random access, which can support a wide range of user loads with relatively low system throughput. Second, to improve the supported user load and system throughput, an edge-classification-based extension (ECE) algorithm is proposed to construct rate-compatible RL-QC-LDPC codes toward enhanced IDMA while taking into consideration the novel structural features of 5G-NR LDPC codes. Based on the two proposed edge-classification methods, the ECE can efficiently reduce the search space of base matrices for each extension round and effectively maintain enough diversity in the selected seed base matrices to facilitate further extension. Multi-edge type density evolution-aided extrinsic information transfer chart is employed to predict the asymptotic performance during the base matrix extension and optimization. As an example, a rate-compatible RL-QC-LDPC code family with fine code-rate granularity is constructed via the proposed ECE.

Building on a set of industry verticals (comprising Industry 4.0, Transportation and Energy), different deployment models are analyzed and the proposed multi-domain solutions are applied. These solutions are implemented and validated through two proof-of-concept prototypes integrating a 5G private network platform (5Growth platform) with public ones.

Both the space-satellite and the terrestrial-mobile systems (TMSs) operate at their respective licensed spectrums. However, due to the scarcity of the available spectrum, a huge amount of data generated indoors, and a high external wall penetration loss of a 3D building, we propose to reuse the satellite spectrum to small cells deployed only in 3D buildings of the TMS. The proposed spectrum sharing technique is detailed by identifying and addressing the major related issues. The co-channel interference generated because of the co-existence of the satellite user equipments (UEs) in the small-cell coverage is analyzed, and the handover procedures for a satellite UE toward and away from any small cell are discussed. The almost blank subframe (ABS)-based enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) technique is employed to small cells in order to assure the quality-of-service (QoS) between small-cell UEs and satellite UEs. We derive the system-level capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency performance metrics for the proposed technique by varying the number of buildings over the coverage of a macrocell and deduce the condition for optimality for both the energy efficiency and the spectral efficiency. With an extensive system-level simulation and numerical analysis, we justify the impact of using the ABS-based eICIC technique toward provisioning QoS in terms of radio resource allocation. Furthermore, we show the outperformance of the proposed technique in terms of spectral efficiency and energy efficiency over the ones expected for the fifth generation (5G) network requirements as well as achieved by numerous existing techniques. Finally, we discuss the radio resource scheduler implementation as well as the significance, challenge, and future research perspective of the proposed spectrum sharing technique."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-03-29,2019-01-01,7,,43846-43868,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The paper focuses on the de-tailed methodology for multi-pair copper channel measurement including measurement equipment specifications, their respective settings, measurement parameters i.e. characteristics impedance, insertion loss (IL), far-end-crosstalk (FEXT) and near-end-crosstalk (NEXT).  The measurements include the cables for next-generation multi-pair system, where multi-pair cables, i.e. CAT-5 cables, are used from the RRU to the DAUs in a building. Conventionally, many multi-pair cables share the same duct in a building and interfere with each other, therefore two parallel multi-pair CAT-5 cables of 50m each are considered for the measurement scenario. This setup result in 4 twisted pairs terminate at each DAU and this configuration is termed as next-generation multi-pair MIMO (NGMM). The number of twisted pairs is increased by using the Phantom mode circuit connected to the opposite ends of each CAT-5 cable and the resulting configuration is called next-generation multi-pair super MIMO (NGMSM). The cable parameters have been measured for frequencies up to 1 GHz and 250 MHz for NGMM and NGMSM, respectively.

To obtain desired MIMO transmission performance, construction of codebooks which are composed of matching beamforming vectors to the array structure is important. To effectively cover different types of mobile traffic, the base station for 5G new radio employs antenna arrays in various sizes and shapes.

The spatial-temporal propagation characteristics in different polarizations in the 5G spectrum are crucial for the network coverage. In this paper, we measured the urban macrocell (UMa) O2I channels at 3.5 GHz in the space, time, and polarization domains simultaneously. The channel sounder utilized two ±45° polarized antenna arrays. The transmitter (TX) was placed on the rooftop of a five-storey building to emulate a base station and the receiver (RX) was moved in the corridors on different floors in another building to emulate user equipments (UEs). We obtained the small-scale parameters of excess delay, power, and azimuth/elevation of arrival (AoA/EoA) of individual multipath components (MPCs), the propagation profiles of azimuth/elevation power spectrum (APS/EPS) and power delay profile (PDP), and the large-scale parameters including azimuth/elevation spread of arrival (ASA/ESA) and delay spread (DS). Based on the measurement results, we propose the lifted-superposed Laplace distribution (LS-Laplace) function and lifted-superposed normal distribution (LS-Normal) function to model the APS and EPS, respectively, and a three-phase model for the PDP.

In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of UAVs traveling over the area of interest to relieve congestion in 5G+ systems under spontaneous traffic fluctuations. To this end, we assess two inherently different offloading schemes, named routed and controlled UAV bridging. Using the tools of renewal theory and stochastic geometry, we analytically characterize these schemes in terms of the fraction of traffic demand that can be offloaded onto the UAV bridge as our parameter of interest. This framework accounts for the unique features of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio propagation and city deployment types with potential line-of-sight (LoS) link blockage by buildings.

In FL, the central aggregator accumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model. However, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership inference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable participants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy leakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means of defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework to create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from being involved in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and unreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend against poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy techniques to prevent membership inference attacks.

"644,pub.1143400831,10.3390/electronics10222880,,,Dual-Band Single-Layer Fractal Frequency Selective Surface for 5G Applications,""Due to the global growth in popularity of Fifth Generation (5G) cellular communications, the demand for shielding against it has risen for a variety of applications, mainly related to cybersecurity but also to isolation, calm areas and so on. This research paper aims to provide a suitable dual-band fractal FSS (Frequency Selective Surface) for the 5G lower band frequencies: 750 MHz and 3.5 GHz. The unit cell is in the shape of a bow tie, where each of the triangular parts are Sierpiński triangles. One major addition to the unit cell is a central metal strip to make the manufacturing of the FSS more feasible and to tune the operation frequencies and bandwidths. As with each different stage of a fractal antenna, the different stages of the fractal FSS design behave differently. For this application, stage 2 is sufficient, as we are able to cover frequency bands among those included in the FR1 5G spectrum. Some equations were derived using linear regression in order to provide specific design tools for building an FSS. These equations have high accuracy and can be used to adapt the proposed design to other frequencies. Some other parameters, which are not represented in the aforementioned equations, can also be adjusted for minor tweaking of the final design. This design performs well except under large incidence angles. This should be taken into account when proposing the installation of a structure based on it. A good agreement between simulation and measurement results is observed."",,""This research was funded by the Spanish Government, Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, Secretaría General de Investigación, grant number PID2020-112545RB-C52";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An eight-element phased-array module is presented employing two wideband 16–52 GHz $4{\times }1$ Tx beamformer chips and tapered slot Vivaldi antenna array. The beamformer chips are designed in a SiGe BiCMOS process and flipped on a printed circuit board (PCB). The SiGe integrated circuit (IC) has four differential radio frequency (RF) beamforming channels each consisting of an active balun, analog adder-based phase shifter (PS), variable gain amplifier (VGA), and a two-stage class-AB power amplifier (PA). The RF input signal is distributed to the four channels using a compact Wilkinson network. The measured peak gain is 28.3 dB with 13.5–14.7 dBm output $P_{1{\mathrm {dB}}}$ and 14–15.4 dBm $P_{{\mathrm {sat}}}$ at 20–50 GHz. Each channel dissipates 250 mW from 2 V and 3-V supplies at $P_{1\,{\mathrm{ dB}}}$ . The beamformer chip is tested using 64-QAM waveforms and achieves a data rate of 2.4 Gb/s at 5.2% rms EVM and 9.6-dBm average power. The eight-element phased-array module shows a broadband performance with excellent patterns and ±60° scanning capability and with a peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 32–34 dBm at 19.5–51 GHz. At an EIRP of 21–22 dBm, 400-MHz 256-QAM 5G-NR compliant waveforms are transmitted with < 2.98% EVM demonstrating 5G NR FR2 operation. To the author’s knowledge, this work achieves the highest bandwidth phased array with a peak EIRP of 34 dBm enabling the construction of multi-standard/multi-band 5G phased-array systems."",The authors would like to thank Tower Semiconductor for the chip fabrication and Keysight for their generous support.

Practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder implementations use message-passing decoding with finite precision, which becomes coarse as complexity is more severely constrained. In turn, performance degrades as the precision becomes more coarse. Recently, the information bottleneck (IB) method was used to design mutual-information-maximizing mappings that replace conventional finite-precision node computations. As a result, the exchanged messages in the IB approach can be represented with a very small number of bits. 5G LDPC codes have the so-called protograph-based raptor-like (PBRL) structure which offers inherent rate-compatibility and excellent performance. This paper extends the IB principle to the flexible class of PBRL LDPC codes as standardized in 5G. The extensions include IB decoder design for puncturing and rate-compatibility. In contrast to existing IB decoder design techniques, the proposed decoder can be used for a large range of code rates with a static set of optimized mappings. The proposed construction approach is evaluated for a typical range of code rates and bit resolutions ranging from 3 bit to 5 bit. Frame error rate simulations show that the proposed scheme always outperforms min-sum decoding algorithms and operates close to double-precision sum-product belief propagation decoding. Furthermore, alternatives to the lookup table implementations of the mutual-information-maximizing mappings are investigated."",""This work was supported in part by the Open Access Funds of the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) in the funding programme Open Access Publishing, in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCF-1911166, in part by Physical Optics Corporation, and in part by SA Photonics.

The benefits are well advertised and range from inducing wellness and monitoring health, amplifying productivity, to energy savings. Comparatively, potential negative risks are less known and mostly relate to cyber-security threats and radiation effects. This meta-integrative qualitative synthesis research sought to determine the possible underlying demerits from developing smart buildings, and whether they outweigh the possible benefits. The study identified five master themes as threats of smart buildings: a surfeit of data centers, the proliferation of undersea cables, the consternation of cyber-security threats, electromagnetic pollution, and E-waste accumulation. Further, the paper discusses the rebound impacts on humans and the environment as smart buildings’ actualization becomes a reality.

This creates overhead in existing wireless systems. This manifests in the continuous development of wireless systems to keep pace with the increasing capacity demand. Increase in the number of users increases congestion in cellular bands, hence Extremely High Frequency (EHF) bands such as mmWave are attracting growing attention for use in cellular networks. Millimeter Wave (mmWave) bands can support multi‐Gigabit rates for large bandwidth applications in Next generation networks. These bands have certain limitations like, these cannot travel long distances and cannot penetrate buildings and other objects. These limitations can be advantageously exploited to provide more secure communication and permit high‐frequency reuse. This will facilitate efficient spectrum utilization and support design of densely packed networks. This paper reviews the propagation characteristics of mmWaves and effect of external factors like atmospheric gases, rain, foliage, and diffraction. Our main focus will be to study the effect of these factors on the propagation of mmWave frequencies to be used for 5G cellular networks.

Recently, they have recognized the power of machine learning (ML) and started to explore its potential to facilitate those network functions. Nevertheless, the current ML models for network functions are often derived in an offline manner, which is inefficient due to the excessive overhead for transmitting a huge volume of dataset to remote ML training clouds and failing to provide the incremental learning capability for the continuous model updating. As an alternative solution, we propose Cocktail, an incremental learning framework within a reference 5G network architecture. To achieve cost efficiency while increasing trained model accuracy, an efficient online data scheduling policy is essential. To this end, we formulate an online data scheduling problem to optimize the framework cost while alleviating the data skew issue caused by the capacity heterogeneity of training workers from the long-term perspective. We exploit the stochastic gradient descent to devise an online asymptotically optimal algorithm, including two optimal policies based on novel graph constructions for skew-aware data collection and data training.

It is widely accepted that the design and analysis of cloud manufacturing architecture (CMfg-A) are the basis for developing and applying CMfg systems. However, in existing studies, analysis of the status, development process and internal characteristics of CMfg-A is lacking, hindering an understanding of the research hotspots and development trends of CMfg-A. Meanwhile, effective guidance is lacking on the construction of superior CMfg-As. The purpose of this paper is to review the relevant research on CMfg-A via identification of the main layers, elements, relationships, structure and functions of CMfg-A to provide valuable information to scholars and practitioners for further research on key CMfg-A technologies and the construction of CMfg systems with superior performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Small cells are dual‐band enabled operating in the 60 GHz unlicensed and 28 GHz licensed millimeter‐wave (mmW) bands. We develop an interference avoidance scheme in the time domain to avoid cochannel interference (CCI) between in‐building NR‐U small cells and WiGig access points (APs). We then derive average capacity, spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE) performance metrics of in‐building small cells. Extensive system‐level numerical and simulation results and analyses are carried out for a number of variants of NR‐U, including NR standalone, NR‐U standalone, and NR‐U anchored. We also analyze the impact of the spatial reuse of both mmW spectra of multiple NR‐U anchored operators with a WiGig operator. It is shown that NR‐U anchored provides the best average capacity and EE performances, whereas NR‐U standalone provides the best SE performance. Moreover, both vertical spatial reuse intrabuilding level and horizontal spatial reuse interbuilding level of mmW spectra in small cells of an NR‐U anchored can improve its SE and EE performances. Finally, we show that by choosing appropriate values of vertical and horizontal spatial reuse factors, the proposed coexistence mechanism can achieve the expected SE and EE requirements for the future Sixth‐Generation (6G) mobile networks."",Conflicts of Interest The author declares that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.,,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,,Giuseppe Piro,,2021-01,2021,2021-09-10,2021-01,2021,1,,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Each SBS architecture is defined as a Type and the spectrum sharing mechanism of each Type of architecture is detailed and mathematically analyzed to define existing dynamic spectrum sharing techniques suggested in the literature. The high external wall penetration loss of a building and the eICIC technique are exploited to manage co-channel interference generated due to sharing the spectrum of one system to another. System-level capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency performance metrics are derived for each SBS architecture to show the relative outperformance of one to another. It is found that, unlike energy efficiency (EE), the spectral efficiency (SE) response of an SBS architecture is directly affected by the channel characteristics as well as the number and amount of operating spectrum bands. However, the number of transceivers of an SBS does not have a noticeable impact on both SE and EE so long as the feature of an operating spectrum is not altered. Finally, we show that each Type of the proposed SBS architectures can achieve the prospective SE and EE requirements for fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks."",""This article was presented in part at the 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (IEEE DySPAN), Newark, NJ, USA, November 2019."",,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-01-13,2020-01-01,8,,15056-15071,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this respect, another important dimension for parallelism is the aggregation of diverse radio access technologies (RATs), such as WiFi, LTE, and 5G, in heterogeneous networks (HetRAT networks). Simultaneous multiple RAT connectivity facilitates both users and network operators in achieving even higher data rates and in balancing the traffic load, respectively. In this paper, we review the technological supports for the realization of the multi-RAT connectivity and focus on a general framework for resource allocation in HetRAT systems. Specifically, a distributed algorithm is proposed to allocate, with minimal overhead signaling, the bandwidths of available RATs among users considering both the system operator’s objective and the users’ demands and constraints. The optimality of the proposed distributed algorithm is further proved, and its convergence is investigated. Finally a test case is introduced in which users are power constrained and the system operator enforces capacity limits and motivates users for a fair load balancing over RATs. Numerical results shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and its fast convergence in few iterations."",,,Wireless Networks,,,,2019-05-22,2019,2019-05-22,2020-05,26,4,2695-2706,Closed,Article,""Heidarpour, Mohammad Reza";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To provide the required spectral efficiency, a key technology that could support the 5G vision is a transmission scheme based on Cooperative Multi Point Transmission (CoMP) combined with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). This, however, requires an optimum resource allocation in a CoMP-OFDM system, which is shown to be a highly complex problem. Our proposal, referred to as scalable CoMP (SCoMP), tackles this complexity by dividing the optimal resource allocation problem into four subproblems such that CoMP becomes scalable and applicable in a practical 5G network without a huge overhead in terms of protocol signaling and backhaul requirements. Namely, these four subproblems are as follows: base station (BS) group formation (clustering), assignment of mobile stations (MS) to BS groups, MS group formation and OFDM frame construction, which are solved independently and therefore at lower complexity. Our approach improves its scalability even further by applying a static but overlapping BS grouping scheme which is MS-unaware. We decrease the potential performance loss due to MS-unawareness that is needed for improved scalability by two mechanisms. First, we propose to use overlapping BS clusters supporting variable cluster sizes which mitigates inter-cluster interference. Second, we apply dynamic grouping of MSs to make sure, only spatially-compatible MSs are being served simultaneously in the same group. Finally, our approach is able to deal with bursty network traffic. The realisation of SCoMP is enabled through the deployment of the software defined networking approaches in the backhaul network."",Declaration of Competing Interest None.,,Computer Networks,,,,2020-04,2020,,2020-04,171,,107105,Closed,Article,""Zubow, Anatolij";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this article, modular massive multiple-in-put multiple-output (mmMIMO) is presented as one candidate technology for 6G to improve the spectral efficiency in low-frequency bands. The 5G New Radio pushed the boundary of the cellular system's operating frequency to high-frequen-cy bands, and this trend will continue in the 6G era. However, the technical advances in 5G for low-frequency bands fall short, although low-frequency bands are crucial in serving a large number of users in a wide coverage area. Although it would be ideal if massive MIMO could be utilized in low-frequency bands, it is less practical due to a large antenna form factor size. mmMIMO is a technology to distribute a large active antenna array with smaller standardized antenna modules, just like Lego-type building blocks. Through this, the benefits of massive MIMO can be achieved in low-frequency bands (e.g., sub-1 GHz), unconstrained by spatial limitations. In this article, the concept of mmMIMO, its applicability, and needed research efforts to standardize the technology for 6G are discussed.

Moreover, the ever-growing number of devices with different Radio Access Technologies (RATs), expected for new 5G scenarios and to maintain compatibility with older cellular standards (mostly 3G/4G), worsen this situation thus calling for novel bandwidth-efficient, low-latency and cost-effective solutions for indoor coverage. To solve this problem, Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures have been proposed to provide dense and controlled coverage inside buildings. However, all-digital C-RAN solutions are complex and expensive when indoor layout constraints and device costs are considered. We discuss here an analog C-RAN architecture, referred to as Analog MIMO Radio-over-Copper (A-MIMO-RoC), that aims at distributing RF signals indoors over distances in the order of 50 m.

This paper addresses such remote interference problem in a 5G new radio (NR) macro deployment context. Specifically, two potential reference signal (RS) designs for remote interference management (RIM) are described. The first signal structure, denoted as the one OFDM symbol (1OS) based RIM-RS, is building on the channel state information reference signals of 5G NR. The second candidate is referred to as the two OFDM symbol based RIM-RS design, which builds on the design principles of LTE RIM-RS. The achievable detection performance is evaluated by introducing enhanced receiver algorithms together with three feasible propagation delay based gNB grouping and corresponding RIM-RS transmissions schemes. The performance results in terms of the receiver processing gain highlight that the improved detection algorithm assures sufficient performance to detect the remote interference for both RIM-RSs with all evaluated frequency domain comb-like patterns. The benefit of grouping corresponding RIM-RS transmissions from gNBs located on the same area is greater when using same frequency domain resources per transmitted sequence in practical interference scenarios. Furthermore, applying a common base sequence for all gNBs within a group allows to identify the group based on detected sequence and enables adaptive RIM mitigation schemes. On the other hand, it is shown that the 1OS RIM-RS provides smaller overhead and can be frequency multiplexed with the physical downlink shared channel, which opens up the possibility of using gNB group wise 1OS RIM-RS also for UE interference measurements."",""The work was supported in part by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Business Finland), under the project 5G-FORCE."",They are presented in the “Acknowledgements” section.,EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,,,,2021-03-05,2021,2021-03-05,2021-12,2021,1,45,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The approach is to land UAV-based mmWave APs on the nearby buildings instead of hovering over the area. Within the developed mathematical framework, we compare the system-level performance of airborne and landed deployments by taking into account the full operation cycle of the employed drones. Our numerical results demonstrate that the choice of the UAV deployment option is determined by an interplay of the separation distance between the service area and the UAV charging station, drone battery lifetime, and the number of aerial APs in use. The presented methodology and results can support efficient on-demand deployments of UAV-based mmWave APs in prospective 5G+ networks."",This work was supported in part by the Academy of Finland (Project RADIANT) and in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant ECCS-1711702.,,IEEE Wireless Communications Letters,,,,2020-07-28,2020,2020-07-28,2020-12-01,9,12,2059-2063,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The difference be-tween the proposed model and the existing prototypes is the complex account for the gains of devices, as well as the influence of radio wave propagation losses, slow and fast fading in the radio channel on the performance of the radio access network. The study is carried out for sessions of directional and omni-directional radio communication, and the beamforming mode is based on the preliminary positioning of neighboring devices. Mathematical modeling of a set of simultaneously operating radio lines in the Poisson model of an ultra-dense 5G radio access network makes it possible to estimate the gain in connectivity and the probability of successful radio reception when forming a beam based on preliminary positioning of devices in comparison with the case of omnidirectional antennas. The results of mathematical modeling of a ultra-dense radio access network with devices equipped with six-element circular antenna arrays showed a significant increase in connectivity indicators and the probability of successful radio reception in comparison with the case of omnidirectional antennas and confirmed the possibility of spatial multiplexing of simultaneous transmissions with a territorial separation of devices on 20% of the range of radio coverage based on the signal-to-noise ratio criterion.

Different from the conventional spatially coupled LDPC(SC-LDPC) codes, the proposed BMST-LDPC codes can have encoder/decoder implemented using the structure of the corresponding LDPC-BCs. The proposed construction is universal, which is applicable to any existing LDPC-BCs including the 5G New Radio (5G-NR) LDPC-BCs to obtain extra coding gains. The proposed BMST-LDPC codes are also a special class of BMST codes, which have lower error floors even with an encoding memory of one, inheriting a low decoding latency. Moreover, partial superposition, where a fraction of the coded bits are superimposed onto the following codewords, is introduced to alleviate the decoding error propagation. The construction can be optimized, for random long codes, by a protograph-based extrinsic information transfer(EXIT) chart analysis, or by a one-dimensional search for structured block codes. Furthermore, the BMST-LDPC scheme is integrated with the hybrid automatic retransmission request(HARQ) over the block fading channel, improving the throughput performance. Numerical results are presented to validate our analysis and demonstrate the performance advantage of the BMST-LDPC codes over the LDPC-BCs. They also show that the proposed HARQ scheme can yield a throughput improvement of up to 10 over the conventional HARQ scheme."",""This work was supported in part by the National Key R&amp";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some key technologies have been put forward in the next generation mobile communication technology (5G) such as millimeter waves and Small Cell to meet the requirements. The development of small cell networks offers higher chances in increasing capacity while reducing power consumption, since the small cells are effective supplements to macro cells with less power consumption in each single small cell. The problem is that deploying dense small cells may not actually save the total power of the system. To solve this problem, the small cells could be switched off during the time when traffic load is not that high, and switched on when large number of users appear in the hot spot area. However, switching off the small cells may lead to lower chance of offloading and harm the throughput. The performances of the algorithm are also evaluated by building a simplified LTE model with one macro cell and several small cells in MATLAB. Besides, the main traffic data of the network comes from the simulation in MATLAB which is considered as more realistic.

Up to 4G systems, users broadcast a cell-connect request omnidirectionally, and the BS replies to the request. In 5G systems operating at mmWave, directional transmissions (by means of beamforming) are needed to overcome strong attenuations. However, during IA the user's and BS's reciprocal positions are not known, and therefore a search procedure explores different directions, substantially increasing the IA overhead. Still, directions of arrival statistics largely depend on buildings and typical user entrance paths, which characterize the cell. By exploiting these statistics IA can be significantly accelerated, by searching more often where users typically are. In order to acquire the statistics, an online method is proposed and its performance is assessed for the first time using real data from a traffic data survey.

In addition, due to that the urban environments are characterized by many high buildings act as diffraction objects can block the signal path and produce non-line of sight (NLOS) situations. These diffraction materials can cause further considerable losses that disturb the received power at the 5G receiver. This paper proposes a new model can investigate the influence of both precipitation and diffraction phenomena on wireless point to point (PPT) communication systems. This new research work utilizes measured rainfall data and actual scenarios in an urban environment to simulate the wireless PPT system and examine the influence of rainfall and knife-edge diffraction (KED) on the performance of the PPT system and signal strength at the receiver. Several durations of exceedances of rain rates and various operation scenarios have been employed to study and analyze the status of 5G wireless system links. The results indicated that there is an exchange of the effect of rain and KED diffraction in the lower millimeter-waves compared to the higher millimeter-waves. This study declares that at higher frequency bands the rain attenuation is observed to be greater, the diffraction loss is higher, and the path loss is also larger compared to the effect of these three factors seen at lower frequency bands. Furthermore, specific carrier frequencies, as in the case of 60 GHz, undergo extra huge atmospheric absorption loss which can diminish the communication coverage of the PPT system link."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-11-25,2020-01-01,8,,212961-212978,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper introduces a novel methodology for the development of integrated thermal, power and mobility 5th generation (5G) smart energy networks. The proposed 5G concept builds on state of the art by connecting flexible electricity demands such as heat pumps, and electric vehicles to intermittent, renewable and secondary energy sources and storage using artificial intelligence to facilitate optimal control and to maximise revenue and carbon savings. The proposed innovative method is being applied in central London through the development of two independent 5G smart energy schemes. The proposed schemes will incorporate a range of different renewables and secondary energy sources, for example, waste heat from local data centres and the London Underground that will supply a large proportion of the energy demand of the overall district network capacity. Both networks will operate at close to ambient temperature, approximately 15–25 °C as a so-called ‘ambient loop’ system, with individual heat pumps for each end-user or building connected to the network. The system also integrates thermal and electrical storage to create additional flexibility for the network and smart control for demand-side management. A smart management system flexibly controls individual assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles in response to price signals reflecting the intermittency of renewable energy sources on the electricity grid. The ambient district thermal loop will distribute low carbon energy to a range of end users. Results presented in this paper provide an understanding of capital costs associated with integrated smart energy systems and the relative performance of individual technologies in a complex system using a techno-economic modelling approach. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the implementation of the 5G concept results in lower energy costs to consumers while at the same time transforming a large existing urban area to a near zero-carbon energy system in terms of heating, cooling, electricity and transport."",""Project GreenSCIES is being funded by InnovateUK (37561), with significant support from all project partners and from EPSRC (Engineering Physical Sciences Research Council) via the LoT-NET (EP/R045496/1) (Low Temperature Heat Recovery and Distribution Network Technologies) programme grant in the UK."",,Energy,,,,2020-06,2020,,2020-06,201,,117389,Closed,Article,""Revesz, Akos";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to the advantages of NFV, 5G networks have adopted NFV as one of its key enabling technologies. One of the most important challenges for realizing NFV-enable 5G Networks is VNF placing and routing. However, most existing studies neglected flow rate fluctuation of service requests, which could cause service migration and fluctuation of queues (buffers) in the networks. In this paper, we study the cost-minimizing problem of VNF placing and routing in this dynamic environment while considering service migration and queue backlog stability. We first formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem. Then we propose an online algorithm, named MACRO, to solve the problem. In order to bound the worst-case delay encountered by requests we propose WEB-MACRO. MACRO and WEB-MACRO base on Lyapunov optimization and make decisions without knowing future information. The theoretical analysis suggests that MACRO and WEB-MACRO achieve an optimality gap of O ( 1 V ) , where V is a tunable parameter that controls the tradeoff between cost and backlogs. In addition, the queue backlogs maintained by MACRO are bounded by O ( V ) and the queue backlogs maintained by WEB-MACRO are upper bounded which accordingly bounds the worst-case delay encountered by service requests. The experiment results suggest that MACRO and WEB-MACRO achieve queue stability and reduce the total cost by 36.49% when V = 2 and 45.84% when V = 6 , compared with the state-of-the-art method."",""This work is supported by National Key RD Program of China (2019YFB1803304), NSFC, China Fund (62072079, 62001087, 61671130, 61671124, 61871097)."",,Computer Networks,,,,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,194,,108115,Closed,Article,""Xie, Yanghao";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in the complex indoor environment, automated reconstruction of detailed 3D models still remains a serious challenge. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel method that couples linear structures with three-dimensional geometric surfaces to automatically reconstruct 3D models using point cloud data from mobile laser scanning. In our proposed approach, a fully automatic room segmentation is performed on the unstructured point clouds via multi-label graph cuts with semantic constraints, which can overcome the over-segmentation in the long corridor. Then, the horizontal slices of point clouds with individual room are projected onto the plane to form a binary image, which is followed by line extraction and regularization to generate floorplan lines. The 3D structured models are reconstructed by multi-label graph cuts, which is designed to combine segmented room, line and surface elements as semantic constraints. Finally, this paper proposed a novel application that 5G signal simulation based on the output structural model to aim at determining the optimal location of 5G small base station in a large-scale indoor scene for the future.

The surrounding entities including the pedestrians, the cyclists are assumed to use a different avoidance system for their safety. Vehicle speed is reported as one of the major factors that causes such severe road accidents that affect other entities on the road. In response, several solutions have been implemented to control the causalities of over speeding ranging from speed camera, speed detectors to car avoidance systems. However, those solutions have not significantly improved the rate of traffic accidents and their impact. Additionally, the current solutions do not ensure timely notification of all the road users (surrounding vehicle drivers, pedestrians or others) that can alleviate crash causalities in case of fatal traffic accidents. The fifth generation (5G) cellular network is predicted to overcome the current limitations of Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) by offering fast, low latency and reliable connections to enable IoV based applications. Fog computing has also been proposed to complement IoV by bringing computational entities in nearby proximity of the vehicles. 5G based fog vehicular networks is a new paradigm that empower real-time and low latency services for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In this paper we proposed a secure and privacy-preserving collision avoidance system in 5G fog based IoV.

The fog nodes aggregate multiple TVRs, verify the signatures on the TVRs and broadcast anonymous notifications to other entities in the vicinity. The protocol makes use of certificateless aggregate signcryption coupled with pseudonymous technique as the building blocks to ensure authentication, integrity, confidentiality and privacy preservation respectively. The batch verification technique is used by the fog devices to allow simultaneous TVRs signature verification for a timely response. The authorization of reporting speed sensors is both guaranteed by the location-based information along with the digital signature to discard all the bogus TVRs.

Representing the recent rapid development of drone technology, UAVs have been widely used in fifth‐generation (5G) cellular networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), such as drone aerial photography, express drone delivery, and drone traffic supervision. However, owing to low altitude and low speed, drones can only limitedly monitor and detect small target objects, resulting in frequent intrusion and collision. Traditional methods of monitoring the safety of drones are mostly expensive and difficult to implement. In smart city construction, a large number of smart IoT cameras connected to 5G networks are installed in the city. Captured drone images are transmitted to the cloud via a high‐speed and low‐latency 5G network, and machine learning algorithms are used for target detection and tracking. In this study, we propose a method for real‐time tracking of drone targets by using the existing monitoring network to obtain drone images in real time and employing deep learning methods by which drones in urban environments can be guided. To achieve real‐time tracking of UAV targets, we employed the tracking‐by‐detection mode in machine learning, with the network‐modified YOLOv3 (you only look once v3) as the target detector and Deep SORT as the target tracking correlation algorithm. We established a drone tracking dataset that contains four types of drones and 2800 pictures in different environments. The tracking model we trained achieved 94.4% tracking accuracy in real‐time UAV target tracking and a tracking speed of 54 FPS. These results comprehensively demonstrate that our tracking model achieves high‐precision real‐time UAV target tracking at a reduced cost."",Conflicts of Interest The authors declares that they have no conflicts of interest.

Traffic hot-spots change over time, which means SCs cannot be deployed in a one-off manner as macrocells normally do, rather they should be constructed in a staged process. Hence, mathematical models that capture the time-varying staged-construction process, are urgently needed for operators to effectively predict the construction period, but are currently lacking. In this paper, inspired by the foam bursting process-a natural phenomenon that can be observed in daily life such as hand-washing, we first propose a novel model that can predict the time-varying expectation and logarithmic variance of SC coverage areas. Then, we verify the model by real network deployment cases.

A visibly and RF transparent composite metasurface utilizing dielectric–metal spectrally selective coatings with high near‐infrared control and low thermal emissivity is proposed, thus achieving a multi‐functional metasurface capable of enhancing fifth‐generation (5G) communication efficiency and exhibiting energy conservation features. The proposed meta‐glass yields 92% peak RF transmission at 30 GHz which corresponds to 20% and 90% enhancement when compared to plain glass and low‐emissive glass substrates. This meta‐glass possesses 86% peak optical transparency at λ = 550 nm, >60% near‐infrared reflection, and >80% mid‐infrared reflection which corresponds to ≈0.2 thermal emissivity. The proposed metasurface design is highly flexible and can be tuned to operate over different frequency ranges owing to its frequency scalability. This study provides a better alternative using earth‐abundant materials compared to low‐emissive glass based on indium tin oxide while boosting the efficiency of 5G communication amenable to window systems demanding simultaneous functionalities for emergent smart/energy‐efficient buildings/cities and autonomous transportation applications."",""Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Min Kim in Metawaves group for fruitful discussions on the RF measurement apparatus and Remy Ko and Rajiv Prinja in the Advanced Photovoltaics‐Photonics and Devices (AP2D) Labs with regard to key discussions on the fabrication of the patterned transparent conductive coatings.

However, there are still two open problems to be addressed. First, telco CDNs are operated upon the underlay network evolving towards information-centric networking (ICN). Different from CDNs that perform on the application layer, ICN enables information-centric forwarding to the network layer. Thus, it is challenging to take advantage of the benefits of both ICN and CDN to provide a high-quality content delivery service in the context of ICN-based telco CDNs. Second, bandwidth pricing and request mapping issues in ICN-based telco CDNs have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we first propose an ICN-based telco CDN framework that integrates the information-centric forwarding enabled by ICN and the powerful edge caching enabled by telco CDNs. Then, we propose a location-dependent pricing (LDP) strategy, taking into consideration the congestion level of different sites. Furthermore, on the basis of LDP, we formulate a price-aware request mapping (PARM) problem, which can be solved by existing linear programming solvers. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our design."",,,Future Internet,,,,2019-06-03,2019,2019-06-03,,11,6,125,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The research has conducted performance tests and network tests on the samples of the components which debugged the problems that occurred during the tests and analyzed and improved the system. The system designed in this study is not only easy to maintain but also very reliable and safe, with a high level of accuracy, and can be used for remote “five remote” and management of switchgear and other related power equipment. Based on this model, a dual middleware PaaS service selection algorithm is proposed, and a utility evaluation strategy is used to load balance the PaaS service. The test results show that the DMPS algorithm has a high selection accuracy and load balancing capability. Combined with the experience of local government investment and financing platform financing risk management and control practices, the financing risk control system established through the study is made more feasible. From the development history of local government investment and financing platforms, we study local government investment and financing platforms from the perspective of historical development and explore the root causes of their high financing risks and possible defects in the management process of daily work. Concerning the existing laws and regulations, practical operation norms, the framework of the local government investment and financing platform system, and other objective conditions, we start to build a financing risk control system for local government investment and financing platforms from both practical and operational management aspects, to find a financing risk control system that is in line with the regulations and effective. Finally, the system will be put into practice, and the effectiveness of the system will be tested by using the simulation operation method, and the results will be adjusted in time for the shortcomings of the system. The system is expected to help local government investment and financing platforms to reduce their risks so that they can provide better services for urban infrastructure construction and become a solid link in the economic development chain."",Conflicts of Interest The author declares that he has no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Sensors,,Guolong Shi,,2021-01,2021,2021-12-06,2021-01,2021,1,,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The future sixth generation of mobile cellular networks (6G) is expected to have the capability to support new and unknown services with changing requirements. Hence, in addition to enhancing its capability by 10–100 times compared with 5G, 6G should also be intelligent and open to adapt to the ever-changing services in the IoT, which requires a convergence of Communication, Computing and Caching (3C).

However, due to the constraint of limited resources when it comes to sensor networks, it is crucial to select a suitable scale of sensor measurements for radio environment map construction. This article proposes an adaptive ordinary Kriging algorithm based on affinity propagation clustering as a novel spatial interpolation method for the construction of the radio environment map, which can provide precise awareness of signal strength at locations where no measurements are available. Initially, a semivariogram is obtained from all the sensor measurements. Then, in order to select the minimum scale of measurements and at the same time guarantee accuracy, the affinity propagation clustering is introduced in the selection of sensors. Moreover, the sensor estimation groups are created based on the clustering result, and estimation results are obtained by ordinary Kriging. In the end, the simulation of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through comparisons with three conventional algorithms: inverse distance weighting, nearest neighbor, and ordinary Kriging.

The Centralized Cloud Server (CCS) provides the facility to compute critical tasks at the central data server, but it consumes more time due to the distance between CSS and edge device. In this article, we discuss the advantages of edge computing over cloud computing to overcome latency and reliability issues in critical applications. Moreover, the idea of processing and analyzing massive applications at the edge comes up with the requirement of building intelligence at the edge to compute complex tasks within a negligible time. Edge intelligence offers intelligence at the edge to process large datasets for critical computations and to overcome storage issues. Also, the performance tolerant connectivity and low-speed rate issues with 4G and 5G can be solved using a 6G wireless network. The 6G connected edge intelligence application offers ultra-low-latency, security, and reliability mechanisms that could be helpful in COVID-19 pandemic situations. We have also discussed the demonstration of aforementioned massive application in the form of a case study on combating COVID-19 situations using 6G-based edge intelligence.

Despite the major advances in 5G, there are still many challenges remaining. 6G and beyond will require even higher data rates, lower latencies, better energy efficiency, and improved robustness. Multiple antenna technologies, which have played important roles in nearly all recent wireless standards, will be key to addressing these challenges. MIMO research continues to evolve, and new MIMO research topics such as enhanced massive MIMO techniques and array architectures hold much potential for 6G and beyond. Cell-free massive MIMO utilize a large number of distributed access points (APs) that jointly serve users in a coordinated fashion, using only local channel state information at each AP. While the performance of cell-free massive MIMO can be analyzed using a similar methodology as in cellular massive MIMO, the fundamental limits, signal processing, and resource allocation are substantially different. In order to reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption in millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems, beamspace MIMO has been proposed to significantly reduce the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains by using lens antenna arrays or phase shifters. Alternatively, the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) concept involves electromagnetically controllable surfaces that can be integrated into large-scale infrastructure such as building walls, airports, and stadiums. There are active and partially passive forms of large intelligent surface (LIS), and variants with either large antenna spacing or continuous aperture. There are also some substantial differences between the new multiple antenna technologies and traditional MIMO systems, such as transceiver design and propagation models. This special issue aims to highlight recent research on multiple antenna technologies."",""The work of Jiayi Zhang was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61971027, in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4182049 and Grant L171005, in part by the Science and Technology Key Project of Guangdong Province China under Grant 2019B010157001, and in part by ZTE Corporation.

A basic distance-dependent path loss model with a Gaussian random variance for shadow fading is utilized in accordance with the maximum-power directional and omnidirectional measurement data, therein exploiting significant path loss exponents in the presence of vegetation. In comparison with the existing ITU-R and 3GPP models, the effect of dense-leaved trees on path loss prediction is similar to that of buildings, whereas these standard models are inapplicable for sparse obstacle-line-of-sight (OLoS) links. Consequently, an azimuth-angle-based path loss characterization is proposed considering the antenna pattern, beam misalignment, and blockage effects. Moreover, several composite and cluster-level small-scale channel parameters, such as the number of clusters, delay spread, and angular spread, are extracted. Analysis of the first-arrival cluster in the OLoS setting reveals that forward scattering through foliage is still dominant and is expected to produce a larger azimuth angular spread of the arrival and compact multipath components in the time domain compared with line-of-sight and reflected clusters. The measurement results improve existing 3GPP channel models for suburban macrocell scenarios in mmWave bands."",""This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1801101, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61671145 and Grant 61960206006, and in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province of China under Grant BE2018121.

One of those challenges is posed by the Centralized Radio Access Network (CRAN) paradigm, whereby different functionalities of the base station are split between a central unit and a remote unit, both connected by a fronthaul/midhaul network. When this centralization includes physical layer functions, stringent capacity and delay constraints are imposed on the fronthaul, thus making its design and deployment more challenging and costly. At this point, the anticipated capacity requirements for fronthaul links are enormous and, as of today, no single technology can support such requirements.

A linear least squares approach will be applied to the unbiased version of hybrid direction of arrival-time of flight (DoA-ToF) measurement model. Thus, the unbiasing constant is first calculated followed by the theoretical mean squares expression calculation, to be utilized for selecting only those reference beacons that guarantee an improvement in the accuracy of the least squares approach. A critical distance expression is also derived that determines the relationship between the noise variance of angle and range estimates in terms of the distance between nodes.

Radio spectrum has become a scarce resource in wireless communications and consequently imposes excessive cost on the high data rate transmission. Several linear and non linear detection techniques such as Zero-Forcing (ZF), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), and Vertical Bell-Labs Layered Space Time (VBLAST) have been introduced. The purpose of such schemes is to mitigate the signal detection problems which are based on trade-offs between the bit error rate (BER) performance and computational complexities. The challenge in the design of massive-MIMO systems is developing less complex and efficient detection algorithms. The problem in building a receiver for massive-MIMO is to de-correlate the spatial signatures on the receiver antenna array. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm viz: Hybrid n-Bit Heuristic Assisted-VBLAST (HHAV) to perform an optimum decoding. We have simulated this structure in dynamic Rayleigh fading channel.

The proposed architecture model further facilitates the realisation of slices providing specific functionality, such as network resilience, security functions, and network elasticity. The proposed architecture consists of four different layers identified as network layer, controller layer, management and orchestration layer, and service layer. A key contribution of this paper is the definition of the role of each layer, the relationship between layers, and the identification of the required internal modules within each of the layers. In particular, the proposed architecture extends the reference architectures proposed in the Standards Developing Organisations like 3GPP and ETSI, by building on these while addressing several gaps identified within the corresponding baseline models.

Despite the major advances in 5G, there are still many challenges remaining. 6G and beyond will require even higher data rates, lower latencies, better energy efficiency, and improved robustness. Multiple antenna technologies, which have played important roles in nearly all recent wireless standards, will be key to addressing these challenges. MIMO research continues to evolve, and new MIMO research topics such as enhanced massive MIMO techniques and array architectures hold much potential for 6G and beyond. Cell-free massive MIMO utilize a large number of distributed access points (APs) that jointly serve users in a coordinated fashion, using only local channel state information at each AP. While the performance of cell-free massive MIMO can be analyzed using a similar methodology as in cellular massive MIMO, the fundamental limits, signal processing, and resource allocation are substantially different. In order to reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption in millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems, beamspace MIMO has been proposed to significantly reduce the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains by using lens antenna arrays or phase shifters. Alternatively, the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) concept involves electromagnetically controllable surfaces that can be integrated into large-scale infrastructure such as building walls, airports, and stadiums. There are active and partially passive forms of large intelligent surface (LIS), and variants with either large antenna spacing or continuous aperture. There are also some substantial differences between the new multiple antenna technologies and traditional MIMO systems, such as transceiver design and propagation models. This special issue aims to highlight recent research on multiple antenna technologies."",""The work of Jiayi Zhang was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61971027, in part by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4182049 and Grant L171005, in part by the Science and Technology Key Project of Guangdong Province China under Grant 2019B010157001, and in part by the ZTE Corporation.

Edge computing with high-efficiency, real-time, and fast features will become part of 5G construction. Utilizing distributed computing and storage resources at the edge of the network to perform distributed data processing tasks can alleviate the load on the cloud computing center, which is also the development trend of edge computing. When a malicious node exists, the error information feedback by the node will affect the result of local perception decision. To solve the problem of malicious behavior of the node, a node trust evaluation mechanism of interactive behavior is introduced. The trust mechanism for edge computing network environments is introduced as a novel security solution. First, the key thought of the trust mechanism proposed in this paper is to establish a trust relationship between edge nodes in open edge computing environment. Then, a multi-source trust fusion algorithm based on time decay aggregates direct interaction trust and different third-party recommendation trust to calculate the global trust of the evaluated nodes.

Such is the case of 4G and 5G. However, in indoor scenarios, where the capabilities of these technologies are significantly affected by the distance to the base station and the materials used in the construction of buildings, Wi-Fi is still the technology of reference thanks to its low cost and easy deployment. In this context, it is usual to find multi-AP Wi-Fi networks whose deployment has been carefully planned. However, the user-AP association decision procedure is not defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard. As a result, vendors choose selfish approaches based on signal strength. This leads to uneven user distributions and nonoptimal resource utilization. To deal with this, densification has been used over the years, but this is expensive as it needs more infrastructure. Moreover, this results in more APs in the same collision domain. To avoid the need for densification, in this paper we introduce WiMCA, a joint SDN-based user association and channel assignment solution for Wi-Fi networks that considers signal strength, channel occupancy and AP load to make better association decisions. Experimental results have demonstrated that, in terms of aggregated goodput, WiMCA outperforms approaches based on signal strength by 55%, providing better user level fairness and accommodating more users and traffic before reaching the point at which densification is needed."",,,Wireless Networks,,,,2021-05-13,2021,2021-05-13,2021-07,27,5,3109-3125,Closed,Article,""Gómez, Blas";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To reliably integrate UAVs into the NR-based network infrastructure, new system models that capture the features of UAVs in urban environments are required. As city building blocks constitute one of the primary sources of blockage on the links from the UAV to its serving base station (BS), the corresponding line-of-sight (LoS) probability models are essential for accurate performance evaluation in realistic scenarios. We propose a LoS probability model in UAV communication setups over regular urban grid deployments, which is based on a Manhattan Poisson line process. Our approach captures different building height distributions as well as their dimensions and densities. Under certain characteristic distributions, closed-form expressions for the LoS probability are offered. Our numerical results demonstrate the importance of accounting for the building height distribution type as well as the orientation of the UAV with respect to its BS.

With the exponential increase of devices, it follows the critical challenge of handling the huge data volume that they produce. Terrestrial networks may not be sufficient for that, or not always available. Satellites then come into play, and they can provide the ubiquitous coverage targeted by 5G. On the other side, aggregation can be an efficient strategy to reduce the amount of traffic, and use network resources in an efficient manner. Building on that, in this work, we consider a hybrid IoT-satellite network architecture for collecting message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) traffic. We design an advanced filter, namely, MQTT message filter aggregator (MQTT-MFA), that performs MQTT topics aggregation in close proximity of MQTT Publishers before data are sent over the satellite link.

Integrating varactors with MS unit cells allows tunability and reconfigurability. This approach was presented in many studies, with frequencies of up to K–band. However, today, higher frequencies are used, especially in communication. This work presents the design of a reconfigurable MS reflector, at Ka-band frequencies, based on a new type of resonant unit cell, with uniformed reflection for wide-incident-angular-range, and a simple stimulating DC bias for each MS unit cell, which allows a two–dimensional (2-D) continuous reflection phase manipulation. The unit cell provides a dynamic reflection phase range of over 300° at a wide bandwidth. Simulations of one-dimensional (1-D) and (2-D) at 37 GHz are presented. A steering range of up to ±48° was obtained for azimuth or elevation. A simultaneous independent 2-D beam steering range of up to ±10° in azimuth and up to ± 5° in elevation, allowing obstacles to overcome covering at a practical angular spatial cone of 20° and 10°, is presented."",,This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2020-07-24,2020,2020-07-24,,9,8,1191,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Methods  The project was completed in Hangzhou, China, from March 2016 to September 2019. Based on the medical service of large social activities, five information terminals are constructed, including on-site mobile terminal, on-board first aid terminal, expert remote consultation terminal, hospital terminal, and command dispatch center. The system can realize the real-time communication of medical information, patient's vital signs, audio, picture and video information, and can also make intelligent scheduling decisions for patients.   Results  5G Emergency Medical information System for Large-scale Social Activities has been completed, which consists of three parts: command and control platform, on-site rescue platform, and evacuation support platform. The command and monitoring platform displays the information of on-site medical teams, ambulances, hospitals and experts through web pages, and realizes multi-party video communication at any time, as well as text, voice and image information of patients' current condition, so as to realize command, dispatch and display statistical summary information. On-site rescue terminal includes patient information input, video signal acquisition and physiological information acquisition equipment. It realizes multiple methods of patient information input, vital signs and physiological information acquisition, multi-angle video acquisition and transmission to the command center. The evacuation support platform includes vehicle emergency terminal, remote expert consultation terminal, hospital terminal and UAV system. Vehicle terminal can scan and transfer with on-site ambulance team, record physiological information during transit, and also acquire and transmit monitor, electrocardiogram and ultrasound information. Hospital terminals can obtain patient information at the first time and prepare for first-aid in hospital. The remote expert terminal can be dispatched by the command center and the hospital terminal, and can join the remote consultation at any time. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system can transfer medical material between any locations.   Conclusions  This system can guarantee the patients to be transported from the scene to the ambulance and finally to the hospital during the large-scale social activities. In the whole process, the information transmission and dispatching decision-making are initially realized, and the statistical report forms can be made.

In particular, the time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) distributions of the first-arriving multipath component (MPC) are derived. These statistics find their utility in many applications such as cellular-based localization, channel modeling, and link establishment for mm-wave initial access (IA). Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, a Boolean model is used to statistically characterize the random locations, orientations, and sizes of reflectors, i.e., buildings. Assuming non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is due to first-order (i.e., single-bounce) reflections, and that reflectors can either facilitate or block reflections, the distribution of the path length (i.e., absolute time delay) of the first-arriving MPC is derived. This result is then used to obtain the first NLOS bias distribution in the localization literature that is based on the absolute delay of the first-arriving MPC for outdoor time-of-flight (TOF) range measurements. This distribution is shown to match exceptionally well with commonly assumed gamma and exponential NLOS bias models in the literature, which were only attained previously through heuristic or indirect methods. Continuing under this analytical framework, the AOA distribution of the first-arriving MPC is derived, which gives novel insight into how environmental obstacles affect the AOA and also represents the first AOA distribution derived under the Boolean model."",,The work of Christopher E.

One of the main features of such networks is over-density and ultra-low latency. It is the Internet of things that is the basic component of the concept of super dense networks. 3GPP suggests planning 5G networks based on the condition that 1 million devices is 1 km2. Also, ultra-low latency communications networks have a big impact on networking methods, especially for the tactile Internet concept. Such networks require decentralization through 1 ms delay requirements. This requires new approaches to building a new generation of networks, which is the reason for the development of new technologies. One such technology is D2D (device-to-device) technology. This technology allows you to reduce the load on the core of the network due to the use of a significant proportion of the traffic directly between devices and reduces the delay in providing services.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Method. Many modern works are devoted to the study of D2D technology, but they are not exhaustive in the study of routing in such networks. It is objective enough to study networks built on the basis of the interaction of devices with each other using D2D technology, since such interactions have proven to be effective technologies. This, in turn, involves the development of appropriate routing methods in networks using D2D technology, especially taking into account the property of over-density 5G networks. The paper proposes a criterion for selecting routes, taking into account interference within the channels forming the network nodes.

Radio environment map (REM) can be applied to improve the utilization of radio resources for the access control of IoT devices by allocating them reasonable wireless spectrum resources. However, the primary problem of constructing REM is how to collect the large scale of data. Mobile crowd sensing (MCS), leveraging the smart devices carried by ordinary people to collect information, is an effective solution for collecting the radio environment information for building the REM. In this paper, we build a REM collecting prototype system based on MCS to collect the data required by the radio environment information. However, limited by the budget of the platform, it is hard to recruit enough participants to join the sensing task to collect the radio environment information. This will make the radio environment information of the sensing area incomplete, which cannot describe the radio information accuracy. Considering that the Kriging algorithm has been widely used in geostatistics principle for spatial interpolation for Kriging giving the best unbiased estimate with minimized variance, we utilize the Kriging interpolation algorithm to infer complete radio environment information from collected sample radio environment information data. The interpolation performance is analyzed based on the collected sample radio environment information data. We demonstrate experiments to analyze the Kriging interpolation algorithm interpolation results and error and compared them with the nearest neighbor (NN) and the inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation algorithms. Experiment results show that the Kriging algorithm can be applied to infer radio environment information data based on the collected sample data and the Kriging interpolation has the least interpolation error."",""Acknowledgments This work was jointly supported by (1) National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61771068, 61671079) and (2) Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (No. 4182041)."",,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,,,,2019-02-03,2019,2019-02-03,2019-02-03,2019,1,1-12,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Tactile Internet is one of the main use cases of the 5G system that will allow the transfer of haptic communications in real time. Latency, availability, reliability, and security are the main design challenges of the tactile Internet system and haptic based bilateral teleoperation systems. An end-to-end latency of 1 ms remains the main challenge toward tactile Internet system realization, not only for the processing and coding delays but mainly for the limitations of light. In this work, we analyze the key solutions to overcome the light limitations and enable the tactile Internet over any distances with the required latency. Building a virtual model or model mediated for the remote environment at the edge cloud unit near to the end user is the main solution. By means of AI, the virtual model can predict the behavior of the remote environment and thus, the end user can interact with the virtual environment with a high system experience. This literature review covers the existing work of the model mediated bilateral teleoperated systems and discusses its availability for the tactile Internet system. Furthermore, the security issues of tactile Internet system and the effect of model mediated system on the required security level of tactile Internet applications are discussed.

Although with significant importance, the traditional signal map construction, e.g., through full site survey, could be time-consuming and labor-intensive as the signal varies frequently over time and the accuracy requirement grows rapidly with the emergence of new applications. The state-of-the arts usually employ crowdsourcing scheme and matrix completion algorithm to solve the dilemma. However, the crowdsourcing scheme usually suffers from uneven distributed and inadequate participants, while the matrix completion methods do not take the specific signal map features into account, thus suffering from sub-optimal recovery results. To this end, in this paper, we study how to effectively reconstruct and update the signal map in the case of partially measured signal maps with smaller cost and propose a GAN-based active signal map reconstruction method (GSMAC). Our method is mainly innovative in two parts: GSMC, GAN-based signal map construction, and ACS, an active crowdsourcing scheme. Specifically, GSMC can effectively update the signal map with only a small number of observations while also fully using the incomplete historical signals to effectively update the signal map online. Meanwhile, ACS consists of a reinforce learning-based active query mechanism which quantitatively evaluates the most valuable measurement site for reconstruction, which further reduces the measurement cost to minimum. The simulation results and real implemented data driven experiments demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of our approach in both accuracy and cost."",,""This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2019YFB2102000 in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 62172215, 62071230, 61872175, and 61832008 in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grants BK20200067, BK20211567, and in part by the A3 Foresight Program of NSFC under Grant 62061146002."",IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,,,,2021-10-14,2021,2021-10-14,,22,4,2190-2204,Closed,Article,""Zhao, Yanchao";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Compared with 4G, 5G NR can provide much more reliable, efficient, flexible networking access services to mobile devices which can escalate the quality of services (QoS) for the users remarkably. The advantages of affordability, easy assembling and quick driving, allow the deployment of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) on a large scale, and provide the elevation for the industrial and the civilian implementations ubiquitously. With the enhancement of cellular networking, the control range of UAS can extend significantly which allows the controller finish their mission far away from workplace and prevents the threats derived from the hazards in the uncertain environment. The Base Stations (BSs) are vital to the cellular-connected UAS because the BSs can provide the Internet access for the UAS and the remote controllers that sends instructions to the UAS and backhauls the packets to the controllers precisely and timely. However, the malicious BSs are great threats to the cellular-connected UAS. Specifically, the malicious BSs are scattered in the legislative BSs and cannot provide formal networking access services to the UAS. What is worse, the attackers can leverage the malicious BSs to disclose the controllers’ privacy and set threats to the public property. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based approach to mitigate the threats from accessing the malicious BSs. We implement the consensus construction on the authentication of networking access to enhance the efficiency of verification between BSs. To achieve the security of cellular connected UAS, we deploy blockchain to maintain the high online rate for accessing networking. Apart from the prevention of accessing malicious BSs, our approach can detect the malicious BSs and eliminate the proportion of the malicious BSs in the cellular networking.

The transition to the fifth-generation network does not solve the existing problems of information security and leads to the emergence of new threats. The main objective of each modulation method of signals is to ensure high bandwidth, proper transmission quality in a noisy communication channel, using the minimum amount of energy. One of the most effective indicators of increasing the level of information security in wireless networks is quadrature modulation, which is used in such networks as: LTE, WiMAX, McWill, DVB-T (T2), Wi-Fi and other radio access networks [1]. One of the promising directions for the development of 5G networks is the use of higher frequency ranges, such as the range of millimeter waves (from 30 to 300 GHz) [2, 3]. A feature of the millimeter wave range is that they provide much wider spectral bands, making it possible to significantly increase the bandwidth in the channels. Thus, when studying prospective protected information systems based on the use of 5G network technology, it is advisable to use a simulation of the signals of the channel-level interaction of subscribers, which allows you to evaluate the basic security parameters at the physical level. Materials and research methods. Fifth generation networks will simultaneously look like any previous generation of mobile networks, and at the same time they will differ significantly from them – and there are a number of explanations that become more obvious if you think about how these changes affect the principles of user and equipment safety networks of the fifth generation. Widespread in the field of digital information transmission, including 5G networks, has received combinational modulation, called quadrature amplitude modulation. Multiposition signals have the greatest spectral efficiency, of which four-position phase modulation and sixteen-position quadrature amplitude modulation are most often used. The quadrature amplitude modulation is a kind of multi-position amplitude-phase modulation, in addition to the phase, the amplitude of the signal for a given type of modulation will also carry information. This leads to the fact that for a given frequency band the amount of transmitted information increases. A brief overview of the existing modulation approaches is presented OFDM (english. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) [4, 5] systems and methods for forming solutions of signal modulation problems for building such systems/ Results. Currently, OFDM technology is widely used in modern wireless Internet systems. High data transfer rates in OFDM systems are achieved using parallel information transfer over a large number of orthogonal frequency subchannels (subcarriers) [6]. The method of synthesizing signal-code constructions with orthogonal frequency multiplexing provides for different scenarios for the use of semi-square modulation depending on the requirements for interception protection, as well as balancing between spectral and energy efficiency. This method can be used in two cases: with alternative and consistent transmission of signals. In the case of alternative transmission, only one of the four subcarriers is used during one channel interval. For efficient use of bandwidth, the proposed method involves the use of the spectrum of three other subcarriers for data transmission in D2D channels (this creates a connection between two user devices that are in close proximity), which allows you to further avoid interference between fixed channels and D2D communication channels. Findings. At present, 5G networks can be considered as one of the necessary components of the digital transformation and digital economy, while the main task in ensuring security in cellular communications is protection against eavesdropping. However, in the future world of smartphones and the Internet of things, in environments with a large number of mechanisms, the probability of listening is likely to fade into the background. Instead, you have to think about such things as data manipulation attacks, which, for example, can be used to command the mechanisms to perform certain actions (for example, open the door or take control of an unmanned vehicle). Mobile network operators, like consumer electronics manufacturers, will be able to offer “security as a service,” with the result that application providers will be able to apply additional levels of security over existing secure cellular network channels when transferring certain types of data. [7] Due to the better spectral density, the proposed signal conditioning method makes it possible to use prototypes of window functions with the best spatial localization properties without violating the orthogonality condition of the signal bases, and accordingly does not require the use of cyclic prefixes when generating the OFDM signal."",,,Open Education,,,,2019-05-14,2019,2019-05-14,,23,2,69-77,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Indeed, in addition to the usual data and multimedia traffic, the Internet of Things (IoT) smart applications are creating new traffic types and relationships involving billions of active nodes like sensors and actuators. This traffic raises a problem of scale, particularly for resource management and decision-making mechanisms. The present work addresses for the first time the joint problem of mapping heterogeneous flows from multiple users and applications to transport blocks, and then packing these blocks into the rectangular grid of time–frequency resources within a flexible 5G new radio frame. Our solution is based on a quality-of-service-based classification of flows followed by an offline construction of two databases. The first one enumerates all possible configurations of transport blocks and the second enumerates all possible configurations of frames. Thus, the sole online processing that remains to be done is to find the optimal block configurations that satisfy a given request vector. Hence, the resolution of this complex joint mapping and packing problem is reduced to a simple resolution of a linear problem, which consists in finding the best configurations. A thorough numerical study shows that our configuration-based solution can map, within few tens of milliseconds, more than 100 flow connections to transport blocks incurring only 3% of overallocation, and then pack these blocks into the grid leading to an upper bound on the optimality gap as low as 2.8%."",""The author would like to express his deepest gratitude to Prof. Ali M.

Thanks to its directional communication by means of antenna beamforming, WiGig is best fitted for short range device to device (D2D) communications, which highly boost the capacity of future 5G networks. However, the use of direct beamforming training (BT) in the process of D2D neighbor discovery (ND) results in large overhead, high-energy consumptions, and low throughput of the whole WiGig D2D networks. In this paper, as standardized WiGig devices are multiband capable, i.e., it includes the unlicensed $\mu W$ band (i.e., 2.4 and 5 GHz) and the unlicensed WiGig band (i.e., 60 GHz), an efficient paradigm for WiGig D2D networks will be proposed. In this paper, the wide coverage $\mu \mathrm {W}$ band is used to assist the construction of WiGig D2D links. By which, each multiband WiGig device decides if it is neighbor device is in its WiGig (60 GHz) range or not based on the $\mu \mathrm {W}$ received signal strength (RSS) from its neighbor while considering the effect of WiGig path blocking. If both devices are discoverable in the WiGig band, the WiGig D2D data link will be constructed between them under the control of the wide coverage $\mu \mathrm {W}$ D2D link.

To overcome this problem, we propose a novel PAPR reduction technique in the transmitter DSP of a fiber mobile fronthaul network, named as iterative selective mapping (I-SLM). The proposed algorithm uses orthogonal phase vectors construction. Several alternative sets of the OFDM symbol are iteratively generated by deterministic sets of orthogonal phase vectors and the one which introduces the lowest peak power value is considered for transmission.

Despite the great potential, neural network designs with SKs still require a lot of expert knowledge and take ample time. In this paper, we first propose a search scheme that effectively reduces the SK design space based on three aspects: composition, performance, and efficiency. Meanwhile, we completely eliminate the model training from our search scheme. Instead, an easily measurable quantity, the information field, is identified and used to predict the model accuracy in the searching process. Additionally, we provide a detailed efficiency analysis on the final designs found by our scheme. Second, based on the analysis we propose a model transformation scheme to better utilize the SK designs on existing models to either reduce the number of parameters or increase the accuracy. Last, considering the extra programming overhead and the expert knowledge required by the model transformation scheme, we develop a compiler prototype to automate the entire process, given the source code of an existing model. Experimental results show that models composed of the sparse kernel designs searched by our search scheme can beat state-of-the-art networks such as ResNets in terms of the accuracy and the efficiency. Also by using our model transformation scheme we can easily improve the accuracy (the same number of parameters) or the efficiency (the same accuracy) upon existing state-of-the-art models."",This work was supported in part by the Director of Computer Application Research Institute Foundation under Grant SJ2020A08 and in part by the China Academy of Engineering Physics Innovation and Development Fund Cultivation Project under Grant PY20210160.,,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,,,2021-02-10,2021,2021-02-10,2021-08-01,22,8,5261-5274,Closed,Article,""Wan, Kun";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the basic architectures for NR-U involves carrier aggregation of an anchor-licensed-NR carrier and a secondary carrier in unlicensed spectrum, which altogether allows for seamless traffic offloading in scenarios where multi-gigabit data rates are required. While today's research on NR-U addresses mostly physical- and protocol-layer aspects, a system-level performance of the NR-U offloading mechanisms has not been investigated thoroughly. In this paper, we develop a mathematical queuing-theoretic framework that is mindful of the specifics of millimeter-wave (mmWave) session dynamics and may serve as a flexible tool for the analysis of various strategies for the integrated use of licensed and unlicensed mmWave bands in terms of the session drop probability and system utilization. To illustrate this, we select three distinct strategies (based on sequential service, probabilistic offloading, or proportional splitting), and complement our mathematical models with a detailed performance evaluation in a representative massive augmented/virtual reality scenario. Based on this quantitative analysis of the selected schemes, we conclude that proportional splitting of traffic between the two mmWave bands leads to a better performance.

This enables the deployment of a flexible and programmable architecture able to provision end-to-end services with different (and sometimes quite) stringent quality of service (QoS) constraints. In this paradigm, service orchestration may take place over single or multiple administrative domains.

The millimeter wave spectrum is part of 5G and covers frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz that correspond to wavelengths ranging from 10 to 1 mm. Although millimeter wave is often considered as a communication medium, it has also proved to be an excellent ‘sensor’, thanks to its narrow beams, operation across a wide bandwidth, and interaction with atmospheric constituents. In this paper, which is to the best of our knowledge the first review that completely covers millimeter wave sensing application pipelines, we provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of different basic application pipeline building blocks, including hardware, algorithms, analytical models, and model evaluation techniques.

In addition, due to that the accelerated growth in many high buildings in a modern city such as Riyadh creates non-line of sight (NLOS) conditions can be represented by diffraction mechanism causes also attenuation loss affects the received wireless signals. This paper presents a new modelling study on the influence of dust storm and diffraction mechanism on wireless point to point (P-to-P) communication links in Riyadh. This unique study uses measured dust storm data and real urban scenarios to simulate the wireless links and investigate the effect on receiver performance based on the receiver sensitivity criterion. Several frequencies allocated for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems have been utilized as operation frequencies. The results showed that there is an inverse proportional between the attenuation loss due to diffraction and the distance over which the signal travels between the transmitter and receiver particularly when either the transmitter or the receiver is more close to the diffraction object. This study reveals that higher frequencies lead to higher diffraction loss, higher dust storm loss as well as higher free space loss. Moreover, certain millimeter-wave frequencies, such as 60 GHz, experience very high losses due to atmospheric absorption that can only operate on very short link distances. Besides, there is a need for high-quality receivers, especially for very high operating frequencies."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-11-06,2019-01-01,7,,162828-162840,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to the short wave-length of mmWave radiation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can use massive antennas and precoding technology to overcome signal attenuation in mmWave channels. However, the cost and power consumption of radio frequency (RF) chains would increase substantially with the number of antennas. Hence, hybrid beamforming was proposed to reduce the number of RF chains in massive MIMO systems. Hybrid beamforming involves RF beamforming matrix construction and baseband precoding matrix derivation. This study focused on the design and implementation of an algorithm for the RF beamforming matrix construction for mobile environments. Accordingly, this study presents a mixture particle filter that exploits the temporal continuity of beam clusters in a mobile mmWave channel to reduce the computational complexity of RF beamforming matrix construction. Moreover, this beam-tracking particle filter is based on parallel processing architecture to support the tracking of multiple beam clusters in the mmWave channel. Finally, the beam-tracking particle filter was implemented on a field-programmable gate array platform and was verified in a hybrid beamforming system for mmWave MIMO systems.

In recent years, the narrowband radio technology has emerged to address this situation: narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), which is now part of 5G. Supporting massive connectivity becomes particularly demanding in extreme coverage scenarios, such as underground or deep inside building sites. We propose a novel strategy for these situations focused on optimizing NB-IoT shared channels through the selection of link parameters: modulation and coding scheme, as well as the number of repetitions. These parameters are established by the base station (BS) for each block transmitted until reaching a target block error rate (BLERt). A wrong selection of these magnitudes leads to radio resource waste and a decrease in the number of possible concurrent connections. Specifically, our strategy is based on a lookup table (LUT) scheme which is used for rapidly delivering the optimal link parameters given a target QoS. To validate our proposal, we compare with alternative strategies using an open-source NB-IoT uplink simulator. The experiments are based on transmitting blocks of 256 bits using an AWGN channel over the NPUSCH. Results show that, especially under extreme conditions, only a few options for link parameters are available, favoring robustness against measurement uncertainties. Our strategy minimizes resource usage in all scenarios of the acknowledged mode and remarkably reduces losses in the unacknowledged mode, presenting also substantial gains in performance. We expect to influence the future BS software design and implementation, favoring connection support under extreme environments."",""This work was supported in part by the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) under Grant PUE22920160100117CO and Grant PIO13320150100020CO, in part by the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) under Grant UBACyT 20020130200096BA, and in part by the Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica (ANCyPT) under Grant PICT-2015-2761.

Heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) is envisioned as a new trend of 5G that uses the advantages of heterogeneous and cloud radio access networks to enhance both spectral and energy efficiency. In this paper, building on the notion of effective capacity (EC), we propose a framework in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)- non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based H-CRAN to meet these demands simultaneously. Our proposed approach is to maximize the effective energy efficiency (EEE) while considering spectrum and power cooperation between a macro base station (MBS) and radio remote heads (RRHs). To solve the formulated problem and to make it more tractable, we transform the original problem into an equivalent subtractive form via Dinkelbach algorithm. Afterward, the combinational framework of distributed stable matching and successive convex algorithm (SCA) is then adopted to obtain the solution of the equivalent problem. Hereby, we propose an efficient resource allocation scheme to maximize energy efficiency while maintaining the delay quality of service (QoS) requirements for all users. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a non-trivial trade-off between delay and energy efficiency in OFDMA-NOMA based H-CRAN systems in terms of EC and EEE and the spectrum and power cooperation improves EEE of the proposed network. Moreover, our proposed solution complexity is much lower than the optimal solution and it suffers a very limited gap compared to the optimal method."",The work of Mahnaz Sinaie was supported by Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) under Grant 96007791.

In this article, a novel architecture named LBS@E is proposed for building delocalized location-based services (LBSs) in the 5G mobile edge computing (MEC) environment that do not require users’ locations. Mobile users can retrieve local information from LBSs deployed on nearby edge servers based on LBS@E. In this way, LBS@E tackles the location privacy problem innovatively by resolving the root cause of the conventional location privacy problem. However, LBS@E raises new challenges to location privacy. A mobile user can still be localized to a particular privacy area co-covered by the edge servers accessed by the mobile user. A small privacy area puts the mobile user's location at the risk of being approximated. In the meantime, the size of the utility area, which determines the amount of local information retrievable for the mobile user, is positively correlated with the number of edge servers accessed by the mobile user. Thus, given a set of accessible edge servers, the mobile user needs to determine which ones to access so that the retrievable local information is maximized and the risk of being localized is minimized. In this article, we model this new location privacy protecting problem formally, analyze its problem hardness and propose an integer programming based approach for finding the optimal solution.

Most existing group key establishment schemes based on a secret sharing target on building up a group key for a threshold access structure and need to compute a t-degree interpolating polynomial in order to encrypt and decrypt the secret group key. This approach is not suitable and inefficient in terms of computational complexity for multipartite group environments which need to realize the multipartite access structures. In this paper, we study the characterization of ideal access structures related to representable multipartite matroids. By employing some existing results, such as the well-known connection between ideal secret sharing and matroids, the recent discovery of ideal multipartite access structures, and the connection between multipartite matroids and discrete polymatroids, we obtain the characterization of a family of representable multipartite matroids, including a sufficient condition for an access structure to be ideal. Based on this result, we provide a complete characterization of representable quadripartite matroids, showing that these access structures related to representable quadripartite matroids are the ideal ones. From these ideal access structures, we can then construct ideal secret sharing schemes for multipartite group communications. Our results are attractive for efficient and secure multi-group-oriented applications."",""This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 61772224, 61872152), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (No. CCNU19TS019) and the Research Planning Project of National Language Committee, China (No. YB135-40)."",,Journal of Information Security and Applications,,,,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,58,,102724,Closed,Article,""Hsu, Chingfang";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This advancements coupled with the evolution of the 5G communication and Internet of Things technologies, has helped in the development in the domain of smart mine construction. The development of unmanned vehicles with enhanced and smart scheduling system for open-pit mine transportation is one such much needed application. Traditional open-pit mining systems, which often cause vehicle delays and congestion, are controlled by human authority. The number of sensors has been used to operate unmanned cars in an open-pit mine. The sensors haves been used to prove the real-time data in large quantity. Using this data, we analyses and create an improved transportation scheduling mechanism so as to optimize the paths for the vehicles. Considering the huge amount the data received and aggregated through various sensors or sources like, the GPS data of the unmanned vehicle, the equipment information, an intelligent, and multi-target, open-pit mine unmanned vehicle schedules model was developed. It is also matched with real open-pit mine product to reduce transport costs, overall unmanned vehicle wait times and fluctuation in ore quality. To resolve the issue of scheduling the transportation, we prefer to use algorithms based on artificial intelligence. In addition to four other models we are proposing a decomposition-based restricted genetic dominance (DBCDP-NSGA-II) algorithm, which retains viable and non-facilitating solutions in small areas in order to improve the convergence, distribution and diversity of traditional high-dimensional multi-objective fast-dominated genetic sorting Algorithms (NSGA-II)."",,,Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education (TURCOMAT),,,,2021-04-11,2021,2021-04-11,,12,5,827-835,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To expand the positioning coverage area and improve the positioning performance by taking advantage of device-to-device (D2D) and self-organizing network (SON) technology, a BDS/SON integrated positioning system is proposed for the fifth-generation (5G) networking environment. This system relies on a combination of time-of-arrival (TOA) and BeiDou pseudo-range measurements to effectively supplement BeiDou signal blind spots, expand the positioning coverage area, and realize higher precision in continuous navigation and positioning. By establishing the system state model, and addressing the single-system positioning divergence and insufficient accuracy, a robust adaptive fading filtering (RAF) algorithm based on the prediction residual is proposed to suppress gross errors and filtering divergence in order to improve the stability and accuracy of the positioning results. Subsequently, a federated Kalman filtering (FKF) algorithm operating in fusion-feedback mode is developed to centrally process the positioning information of the combined system. Considering that the prediction error can reflect the magnitude of the model error, an adaptive information distribution coefficient is introduced to further improve the filtering performance. Actual measurement and significance test results show that by integrating BDS and SON positioning data, the proposed algorithm realizes robust, reliable, and continuous high precision location services with anti-interference capabilities and good universality. It is applicable in scenarios involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous driving, military, public safety and other contexts and can even realize indoor positioning and other regional positioning tasks."",,""This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 41974032), and the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi province, China (grant number 2021JM-323)."",Remote Sensing,,,,2021-10-23,2021,2021-10-23,,13,21,4261,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On the other hand, more heavy and time-varying traffic loads are generated in an MPTCP network, so that an efficient congestion control mechanism that schedules the traffic between multiple subflows and avoids congestion is highly required. In this paper, we propose a decentralized learning approach, DeepCC, to adapt to the volatile environments and realize the efficient congestion control. The Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) is used to learn a policy of congestion control for each subflow according to the real-time network states. To deal with the problem of the fixed state space and slow convergence, we adopt two self-attention mechanisms to receive the states and train the policy, respectively. Due to the asynchronous design of DeepCC, the learning process will not introduce extra delay and overhead on the decision-making process.

By facilitating continuous and high data rate services between physically proximate devices without interconnection with access points (AP) or service network (SN), spectral efficiency of the 5G network can be drastically increased. However, due to its inherent open wireless communicating features, security issues and privacy risks in D2D communication remain unsolved in spite of its benefits and prosperous future. Hence, proper D2D authentication mechanisms among the D2D entities are of great significance. Moreover, the increasing proliferation of smartphones enables seamlessly biometric sensor data collecting and processing, which highly correspond to the user’s unique behavioral characteristics. For the above consideration, we present a secure certificateless D2D authenticating mechanism intended for extreme scenarios in this paper. In the assumption, the key updating mechanism only requires a small modification in the SN side, while the decryption information of user equipment (UEs) remains constant as soon as the UEs are validated. Note that a symmetric key mechanism is adopted for the further data transmission. Additionally, the user activities data from smartphone sensors are analyzed for continuous authentication, which is periodically conducted after the initial validation. Note that in the assumed scenario, most of the UEs are out of the effective range of cellular networks. In this case, the UEs are capable of conducting data exchange without cellular connection. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can provide adequate security properties as well as resistance to various attacks. Furthermore, performance analysis proves that the proposed scheme is efficient compared with state-of-the-art D2D authentication schemes."",,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Korean Government under Grant NRF-2017R1D1A3B03034005 and by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2017R1A6A1A03015496).,Symmetry,,,,2019-08-01,2019,2019-08-01,,11,8,969,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In newer services, various forms of mobile devices are expected to appear in diverse locations, and beamforming need to accommodate such directional diversification. However, utilization of existing array structures has a limitation in transmitting signals to arbitrary receiver positions in the three-dimensional space. Therefore, a new type of array capable of forming accurate beams in isotropic fashion is desired, and the corresponding transmission strategies need to be identified. In this paper, the construction and utilization of the three-dimensional uniform spherical array (USA) are investigated. Beamforming vectors and the basis codebook for such arrays are defined, and characteristics of the generated beams are analyzed via comparison to the beams produced by conventional arrays.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel compressed sensing (CS)-based nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme, called the CS-NOMA MIMO scheme, for the downlink of massive mission-critical machine-type communication (mmcMTC). By taking advantage of tensor CS techniques, a novel tensor CS-based packet (frame) structure, called TCS packet (frame), is proposed for the CS-NOMA MIMO scheme to further reduce the transmit time intervals (TTIs), resulting in smaller latency than that using the conventional packet (frame) structure. In the TCS packet (frame) structure, the CS signatures are assigned not only to different users but also to different time slots and different symbols of a time slot, thus achieving a user, time slot, and symbol overload system. We present a sufficient condition for the construction of the CS signatures that ensure effective deployment of tensor CS-based multiuser detection (CS-MUD) in user receivers. Furthermore, we consider the case of imperfect channel state information (CSI) and present an upper bound for the performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve high user overload (up to 5) and time slot overload (up to 3) when the activity ratio of users is 1%. When the time slot overload is 3, the proposed scheme with the TCS packet (frame) shortens time slots by at least 2/3 times that of the typical grant-based NOMA schemes. In addition, the block error rate (BLER) of the proposed scheme with the TCS packet (frame) is much lower than that with the conventional packet (frame), even less than 10−9 by repeat transmission when the time slot overload is 3."",""This work was supported in part by the National Science and Technology Major Project under Grant 2018ZX03001019-003, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61629101, Grant 61871041, and Grant 61671086, the Beijing Natural Science Foundation and Municipal Education Committee Joint Funding Project under Grant KZ201911232046, and the 111 Project under Grant B17007."",,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-07-17,2019-01-01,7,,97624-97640,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to their construction characteristics and performance, they are expected to be utilized for flexible scenarios in 6G. For a given length of information, various code rates can be achieved by changing the number of frozen bits and by puncturing techniques. However, the arbitrary code rate is limited due to the core matrix, and the decoding performance is degraded resulting from the puncturing techniques. In order to improve the performance, this paper proposes a novel puncturing pattern selection scheme using an additional encoding process based on feedback values at the transmitter. The proposed scheme guarantees the punctured codeword bits to be definitely known by the receiver. As a consequence, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the punctured codeword bits can be accordingly set to infinity at the decoder, resulting in the performance improvement. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed puncturing scheme outperforms the existing schemes with a slightly increased complexity."",This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61601403 and 61671143).,,Physical Communication,,,,2021-06,2021,,2021-06,46,,101346,Closed,Article,""Huang, Yuting";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We develop an interference management scheme, model user statistics per SC, and interferer statistics per apartment and formulate the amount of the 28 GHz and 60 GHz spectra per MNO. We derive average capacity, spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), and cost efficiency (CE) when employing the proposed technique, as well as the traditional static licensed spectrum allocation technique. We discuss the implementation of the proposed technique and evaluate the performance under two scenarios, namely, SCs operate only in the 28 GHz in scenario 1, and both 28 GHz and 60 GHz in scenario 2. Extensive results and analyses are carried out for four MNOs, i.e., MNOs 1, 2, 3, and 4, in scenario 1.

Establishing a harmonious human–computer interaction environment in the multidimensional information space is one of the development goals of information technology. Face information is important information for identifying the identity of others. Three‐dimensional information has important applications in many fields and directions of machine vision. Therefore, the three‐dimensional common face image has a significant meaning. In this paper, binocular stereo vision system is used to collect multiple pairs of facial information images. The image correction method was used to correct the collected image pairs. According to the basic criteria of stereo matching, the advantages and disadvantages of various traditional image matching methods are analyzed. On the basis of completing the image correction, the graph cut matching method is selected as the matching method, and multiple pairs of collected image pairs are matched by this method to obtain a multi‐angle face disparity map. In this paper, after studying the basic dense matching algorithm and its improved algorithm, the SAD, SD, and NC methods of fixed window are used to compare the matching cost and the performance of the adaptive weight method in face matching. This paper studies the virtual roaming technology and the basis of the related Internet of Things (IoT) 3D face graphics theory and develops a building virtual roaming system based on MFC and OpenGL. The system draws on the basic I/0 device of the computer and provides users with a friendly MFC interface and multiple viewing angles and multiple roaming mode options for virtual faces. Experimental research shows that the reconstruction accuracy of the spatial points of the reconstructed face and the actual situation are both about 1%, which shows that the IoT 3D face modeling algorithm designed in this paper has high accuracy."",,,International Journal of Communication Systems,,,,2020-11-27,2020,2020-11-27,2022-03-25,35,5,,Closed,Article,""Zhao, Hongjun";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To overcome these constraints, i.e. to increase the spectrum availability and utilization, in this paper, we present a new paradigm for the spectrum allocation called licensed countrywide full-spectrum allocation (LCFSA) to allocate the licensed countrywide full 28 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum to each MNO of a country to operate its small cells per building subject to avoiding co-channel interference (CCI). Since most data is generated indoors, the countrywide full mmWave spectrum allocated to an MNO is considered reusing further to its in-building small cells. CCI avoidance in both the time-domain and frequency-domain is presented along with deducing the conditions for optimality. We derive average capacity, spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), and cost efficiency (CE) for LCFSA, and perform extensive numerical and simulation results and analyses for a country consisting of four MNOs. It is shown that LCFSA with both the time-domain and frequency-domain CCI avoidance schemes provide similar performance improvement in average capacity, SE, EE, and CE by about 296%, 164%, 75%, and 60% respectively for no interfering user equipments (UEs), whereas by about 59.2%, 6.1%, 37.2%, and 0.45% respectively for all interfering UEs with the frequency-domain CCI scheme. Moreover, it is found that the improvement in the above metrics does not change with the spectrum reuse factor (RF) and the number of buildings of small cells per macrocell ${L}$ , and the impact of interfering UEs can be compensated by adjusting RF. Finally, we show that LCFSA can satisfy the SE and EE requirements for sixth-generation (6G) systems by adjusting either RF or $L$ , or both."",""This article has been presented in part at the 2020 IEEE 92nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2020-Fall), Victoria, BC, Canada, October 4–7, 2020."",,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-09-10,2020-01-01,8,,166612-166629,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the security of specific voice control system needs to be improved, because the voice cloning technology based on transfer learning can easily simulate the voice of the controller, which may lead to industrial accidents and other potential security risks. Therefore, this article mainly aims to study and understand the principle of voice cloning attack technology, putting forward a voice clone attack method, in order to prepare for the construction of a specific voice recognition system in the future. At present, the key technology of voice cloning attack is how to solve the problem that the target speaker's personalized speech with high quality cannot be synthesized under small samples. In fact, voice cloning is a very challenging problem because speech is more difficult to be represented in the hidden space of the model. We propose a transductive voice transfer learning method to learn the predictive function from the source domain and fine-tune in the target domain adaptively. The target learning task and the source learning task are both synthesizing speech signals from the given audio, while the datasets of both domains are different. By adding different penalty values to each instances and minimizing the expected risk, an optimal precise model can be learned. In addition, an evaluation method to verify the audio similarity of the target speaker was given to show the similarity between the synthesized audio and the original audio. Many details of the experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize the speech of the target speaker with small samples."",""This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs: Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing.

Exploiting physical-layer features to counter spoofing attacks is a promising solution. Although various physical-layer spoofing attack detection (PL-SAD) techniques have been proposed for conventional 802.11 networks in the sub-6GHz band, the study of PL-SAD for 802.11ad networks in 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) 60GHz band is largely open. In this paper, to achieve efficient PL-SAD in 5G networks, we propose a unique physical layer feature in IEEE 802.11ad networks, i.e., the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) trace obtained at the receiver in the sector level sweep (SLS) process. The SNR trace is readily extractable from the off-the-shelf device, and it is dependent on both transmitter location and intrinsic hardware impairment. Therefore, it can be used to achieve an efficient detection no matter the attacker is co-located with the legitimate transmitter or not. To achieve spoofing attack detection, we provide two methods based on different machine learning models. For the first method, the detection problem is formulated as a machine learning classification problem. To tackle the small sample learning and fast model construction challenges, we propose a novel neural network framework consisting of a backpropation network, a forward propagation network, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Another method involves a Siamese network, in which the similarity between sample pairs from one device is used to achieve PL-SAD. It can tackle the training problem that the historical data cannot support the identification of the same device in a new communication session. We conduct experiments using off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices, Talon AD7200s and MG360, to evaluate the performance of the proposed PL-SAD schemes. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PL-SAD schemes, and the detection accuracy can reach 99% using small sample sizes under different scenarios."",""This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Research Project of Hebei, China, under Grant QN2019059 and in part by the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) and its Northern Virginia (NOVA) Node, an investment in the advancement of cyber research and development, innovation, and workforce development."",,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,,,,2021-01-12,2021,2021-01-12,2021-05-01,20,5,3321-3335,Closed,Article,""Wang, Ning";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We introduce the concept of a CDN slice, that is, a CDN service instance which is created upon a content provider's request, is autonomously managed, and spans multiple, potentially heterogeneous, edge cloud infrastructures. Our design is tailored to a 5G mobile network context, building on its inherent programmability, management flexibility, and the availability of cloud resources at the mobile edge level, thus close to end users. We exploit Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) technologies, proposing a system which is aligned with the recent NFV and MEC standards.

Four sub-channels carrying different vector quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) data are modulated to the upper sideband (USB) by I/Q modulation, while the vector unmodulated RF signal is located at the lower sideband (SSB) of the suppressed center carrier. They are used to generate four different mm-wave carriers after heterodyne beating. Due to the imbalance effect of I and Q components from the I/Q modulator, we also optimize the frequency of USB and LSB to reduce the crosstalk between the USB and LSB signal. The experimental results indicate that four-channel QPSK (2 × 2 × 4 = 16 Gbit/s) and 16-QAM (2 × 4 × 4 = 32 Gbit/s) signals with 5 GHz channel spacing at Q-band can be transmitted over 80 km single-mode-fiber 28 and 0.5 m wireless link without dispersion compensation."",,,IEEE Photonics Journal,,,,2019-08-13,2019,2019-08-13,,11,4,1-9,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To reconcile the conflict between the large antenna arrays and the limited amount of radio-frequency (RF) chains in mmWave systems, the so-called hybrid beamforming becomes a promising solution and has received a great deal of attention in recent years. However, existing research on hybrid beamforming focused mostly on the physical layer or signal processing aspects. So far, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of how hybrid beamforming could affect mmWave network optimization.

User profiling has become an important issue for industries to improve company profit. In the 5G era, smartphone applications have become an indispensable part in our everyday lives. Users determine what apps to install based on their personal needs, interests, and tastes, which is likely shaped by their gendersthe behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with their sex. It is possible to profile users gender based simply on a single snapshot of apps installed on their smartphones. With this inference based on easy to access data, we can make smartphone systems more user-friendly, and provide better personalized products and services. In this article, we explore such possibilities through an empirical study on a large-scale dataset of installed app lists from 15000 Android users. More specifically, we investigate the following research questions: 1) What differences between females and males can be explored from installed app lists? 2) Can user gender be reliably inferred from a snapshot of apps installed? Which snapshot feature(s) are the most predictive? What is the best combination of features for building the gender prediction model? 3) What are the limitations of a gender prediction model based solely on a snapshot of apps installed on a smartphone? We find significant gender differences in app type, function, and icon design. We then extract the corresponding features from a snapshot of apps installed to infer the gender of each user. We assess the gender predictive ability of individual features and combinations of different features. We achieve an accuracy of 76.62 and area under the curve of 84.23 with the best set of features, outperforming the existing work by around 5 and 10, respectively.

The received power data are processed, using a novel approach, to identify rain events and to remove the wet antenna effect, with the aim of accurately quantifying the fade induced by precipitation, $A_{R}$ . Moreover, $A_{R}$ is estimated by taking advantage of the ancillary data collected by the laser-based disdrometer collocated with the link transceivers. The results definitely point out the higher prediction accuracy achieved by exploiting the information on the rain drop size. A full year of data are used as reference to test the accuracy of the statistical prediction model for terrestrial links currently recommended by the ITU-R, which reveals a large overestimation.

The antenna element consists of a main radiator, two baluns, and a reflector. Two methods are used to enhance bandwidth and improve the port-to-port isolation. Firstly, by integrating the parasitic elements to traditional dipoles, new resonant modes are introduced to realize broadband, which can be controlled flexibly. Subsequently, part of the parasitic elements is removed to form asymmetric dipoles. Due to the asymmetry construction of the design, the polarization isolation of the antenna achieves more than 30 dB in the whole working band with stable radiation patterns. In addition, the specially designed parasitic elements achieve enhanced bandwidth without increasing the size of the radiator. The Simulation and measurement results show that the antenna has an impedance bandwidth of 32.7% (690-960 MHz). Moreover, a stable half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of 68°±5° and a high gain of 8.5±0.3 dBi is achieved.

Traditional open-pit mine transportation systems rely on human power for command, which often causes vehicle delay and congestion. The operation of unmanned vehicles in an open pit mine relies on many sensors. Using big data from the sensors, we optimize vehicle paths and build an efficient intelligent transportation system. Based on large amounts of data, such as unmanned vehicle GPS data, vehicle equipment information, production plan data, etc., with the goal of reducing vehicle transportation costs, total unmanned vehicle delay time, and ore content fluctuation rate, a multi-objective intelligent scheduling model for open-pit mine unmanned vehicles was established, and it is aligned with actual open pit mine production. Next, we use artificial intelligence algorithms to solve the scheduling problem. To improve the convergence, distribution and diversity of the classical fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve constrained high-dimensional multi-objective problems, we propose a decomposition-based constrained dominance principle genetic algorithm (DBCDP-NSGA-II), retaining feasible and non-feasible solutions in sparse areas, and compare it with four other commonly-used multi-objective optimization algorithms. Simulation analysis shows our algorithm provides the best overall performance results of the multi-objective models. Furthermore, we apply intelligent scheduling models and optimization algorithms to mining practice and obtain new truck operation routes and schedules, reducing truck operation costs by 18.2%, truck waiting time by 55.5%, and ore content fluctuation by 40.3%. For open-pit mine unmanned transportation, the approach provides a variety of optimized solutions for minimum transportation costs, minimum waiting time, minimum ore content fluctuation rate, and a balance of the three indicators.

There are a IoT of works focusing on the WSN in industrial IoT. For example, in, a WSN-based hidden Markov model is proposed to estimate the occupancy in the building (also see other works [1], [2]). In this paper, the research focus on 3-D mobile robot tracking in 5G wireless communication combine to sensor network and mobile robot path planning. The mobile robot can move fast in the three-dimensional (3-D) indoor industrial environment for many tasks such as the monitoring of possible damages on industrial plants [3], data gathering and transmission from wireless communication [4], transportation [5]."",,,«System analysis and applied information science»,,,,2019-07-05,2019,2019-07-05,,,1,16-24,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Accurate fault location is the basis of slice management. In virtualized network model, the function of network elements is software, the underlying layer is highly abstract, the structure changes dynamically, and common cause faults occur frequently, which brings difficulties to fault location. Deep Learning is a machine Learning method that USES Deep Neural Network (DNN) with multiple hidden layers to complete Learning tasks. The essence is that by building a neural network model with multiple hidden layers and using a large amount of training data to learn more useful features, the accuracy of model prediction or classification can be improved. Based on the theory of deep mapping learning algorithm, a scheduling algorithm based on event-driven access point, improved time-driven access point and idle network is designed for centralized wireless network control system. Aiming at the centralized wireless network control system, this paper designs a scheduling algorithm based on event-driven access point, improved time-driven access point and network idleness. The designed sensor network node platform uses the programmable logic controller as the main control chip, contains the data interface module that realizes the communication function between the node and the upper computer, and the acquisition and conditioning module responsible for the collection and conditioning and conversion of the analog signal. At the same time, the TCP and UDP are compared and studied. The accuracy of the model is verified, and the interference distribution of the model and the influence of the D2D inter-pair distance on the system performance are simulated. The distance between the D2D pairs under the given simulation parameters has a certain influence on the system performance. As the distance increases, the system performance will deteriorate, but the impact is not a big conclusion."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-10-25,2019-01-01,7,,156489-156499,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, infrastructure might not always be available because of slow deployment. At the same time, vehicular networks are becoming a reality now and cars are being equipped with a variety of short-range communication devices. The idea of vehicular micro clouds is to turn cars into (virtual) edge computing infrastructure. One of the challenging questions in this domain is to maintain data within and among such micro clouds. In this paper, we focus on this task and present a novel solution for such data exchange between vehicular micro clouds. For efficient operation, the dwell times of cars in such a micro cloud need to be known or accurately predicted. In an extensive study based on trace data, we investigate the distribution of dwell times of cars at intersections. We make use of this distribution as an input for designing an improved data exchange algorithm. As not all intersections are the same, adding additional variance further benefits the solution. We evaluated our algorithm in different vehicular densities, and we observed that we could maintain data 22–208% longer within the micro clouds using our new algorithm. Overall, our results show that our algorithm clearly outperforms previous solutions."",""Declaration of Competing Interest One or more of the authors of this paper have disclosed potential or pertinent conflicts of interest, which may include receipt of payment, either direct or indirect, institutional support, or association with an entity in the biomedical field which may be perceived to have potential conflict of interest with this work.

Motivated by the hard delay requirement for ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in 5G wireless networks, we aim at designing medium access control (MAC) schemes to guarantee successful node-to-node transmission within a bounded delay. To provide a hard guarantee on the transmission delay, deterministic sequence schemes are preferred to probabilistic schemes such as carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Therefore, we mainly consider sequence schemes, with the goal to design schedule sequence set to guarantee successful broadcast/unicast within a common sequence period. This period should be as short as possible since it determines an upper bound on the transmission delay. In previous works, we have considered sequence design under time division duplex (TDD). In this paper, we focus on another common duplex mode, frequency division duplex (FDD). For the FDD case, we present a lower bound on period of feasible sequence sets, and propose a sequence construction method by which the sequence period can achieve the same order as the lower bound, for both broadcast and unicast models.

Data collected by WMSNs, part of IoT systems, are high-dimensional, multilevel, unstructured, and large-scale complex data. Effective nearest neighbor searching faces the “dimension curse” problem. To this end, by incorporating the neighborhood rough set (NRS) approach, this article proposes a novel and effective locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method for high-dimensional WMSN data based on the neighborhood (NLSH). This method innovatively combines the neighborhood knowledge representation method with the LSH mechanism and extends the indexing ability of LSH. Moreover, this method does not require any prior knowledge and has good universality. The indexing method of neighborhood bucket building can reduce the number of searches and improve the response speed of the WMSN system. Extensive experiments have been carried out on several real-world multimedia data sets. The results show that a large-scale high-dimensional NLSH search based on the NRS approach can efficiently query the target point and produce very accurate results.

In this paper, we analyze the tail of the cumulative distribution function of block fading channels in the regime of extremely rare events, i.e., the ultra-reliable (UR) regime of operation. Our main contribution consists of providing a unified framework for statistical description of wide range of practically important wireless channel models in the UR regime of operation. Specifically, we show that the wireless channel behavior in this regime can be approximated by a simple power law expression, whose exponent and offset depend on the actual channel model. The unification provides a channel-agnostic tool for analyzing and performance optimization of radio systems that operate in the UR regime. Furthermore, the unified model is particularly useful in the emerging measurement campaigns for empirical characterization of wireless channels in the regime of low outages. Finally, the asymptotic analysis can serve as an underlying building block for designing more elaborate, higher-layer technologies for URC. We showcase this by applying the power law results to analyze the performance of receiver diversity schemes and obtain a new simplified expression for maximum ratio combining."",""This work was supported in part by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program, through the ERC Consolidator, under Grant 648382 WILLOW."",,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,,,,2019-03-05,2019,2019-03-05,2019-04-01,18,4,2229-2243,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, these methods result in noisy edges during the graph construction stage and overlook detailed knowledge extraction, leading to reduced performance in semantic matching. In this article, a two-layer heterogeneous knowledge graph network is proposed to solve the above problems. The proposed model incorporates category knowledge and local knowledge for improved data representation. Specifically, a category-based hierarchical knowledge graph is constructed to learn representations of knowledge concepts through a hierarchical correlation graph embedding (HCGE) module. Then, a globally guided local attention (GLA) module is used to extract fine-grained local knowledge.

The benefit of adopting these bands of the frequency spectrum is two-fold. First, most of these bands appear to be unutilized and they are free, thus suggesting the absence of interference from other technologies. Second, the availability of a larger bandwidth offers higher data rates for all users, as there are higher numbers of users who are connected in a small geographical area, which is also stated as the Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, high-frequency band poses several challenges in terms of coverage area limitations, signal attenuation, path and penetration losses, as well as scattering. Additionally, mmWave signal bands are susceptible to blockage from buildings and other structures, particularly in higher-density urban areas. Identifying the channel performance at a given frequency is indeed necessary to optimize communication efficiency between the transmitter and receiver. Therefore, this paper investigated the potential ability of mmWave path loss models, such as floating intercept (FI) and close-in (CI), based on real measurements gathered from urban microcell outdoor environments at 38 GHz conducted at the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Kuala Lumpur campus. The measurement data were obtained by using a narrow band mmWave channel sounder equipped with a steerable direction horn antenna. It investigated the potential of the network for outdoor scenarios of line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) with both schemes of co- (vertical-vertical) and cross (vertical-horizontal) polarization. The parameters were selected to reflect the performance and the variances with other schemes, such as average users cell throughput, throughput of users that are at cell-edges, fairness index, and spectral efficiency. The outcomes were examined for various antenna configurations as well as at different channel bandwidths to prove the enhancement of overall network performance. This work showed that the CI path loss model predicted greater network performance for the LOS condition, and also estimated significant outcomes for the NLOS environment. The outputs proved that the FI path loss model, particularly for V-V antenna polarization, gave system simulation results that were unsuitable for the NLOS scenario."",,,Electronics,,,,2019-05-03,2019,2019-05-03,,8,5,495,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Recent advancements toward 5G networks add to the complexity where billions of devices, both static and mobile, are connected generating trillions of megabits of data flooding the network and where service providers scuffle daily to deliver key performance indicators: Lower latency, longer battery life, higher data rates, ultra-high reliability, and more connected devices. The optical-fiber world simultaneously witnesses a denser, fiber-rich network infrastructure which is critically challenged in fast economically developing countries by heavy construction of roads and other infrastructures that inflict repeated and unpredictable cuts to the extent that traffic is simultaneously interrupted in up to 10 of the optical links. Thus, network resiliency to fiber failures is already and will continue to be a top priority for operators. Depending on the SLA, operators choose from various resiliency options, e.g., at single network layers or across multiple ones, with dedicated protection or shared restoration, depending on decisive factors like network availability and total cost of ownership (TCO). With traditional network architectures, high resiliency comes with significantly increased TCO involving optical transport network (OTN) switches, L1 protection switching, and L1 restoration. This translates into high CAPEX and excessive space and power consumption, hampering the desirable seamless scalability with the continuously increasing demand for more capacity. This paper explores an alternative hyperscale network architecture, which is adaptable and resilient to multiple fiber failures, thus delivering committed service levels to the end users and which, at the same time, significantly reduces network cost compared to a traditional all OTN-switched network. The hyperscale architecture exploits low footprint carrier grade, data center interconnect type high-density transponders and cost-effective optical protection switching and restoration via software defined networking control. The paper also describes a routing and grooming algorithm to dimension a shared resource pool for optical restoration and a statistical simulation method for time effective execution, simulating failures over a carefully selected sub-set of failure scenarios to guarantee a high degree of network availability. Via network simulation, the paper demonstrates that multiple failure resiliency and cost effectiveness do not necessarily represent a contradiction in transport networks as long as an appropriate network architecture is chosen and that efficient network planning and optimization are applied."",""This work was supported in part by the H2020 METRO-HAUL project under Grant 761727, in part by FCTMEC through national funds, and in part by FEDERPT2020 partnership agreement under the Project UIDEEA500082019."",,Journal of Lightwave Technology,,,,2019-05-31,2019,2019-05-31,,37,16,4062-4072,Closed,Article,""Gangopadhyay, Bodhisattwa";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Increasing consumers' interest in efficient energy consumption and distributed energy resources requires an EMS that can manage large numbers of powered devices within homes, buildings, and residential areas. An energy management agent (EMA) is a technology standard under development by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 25/WG 1. The EMA standard offers convenient and intelligent energy management services while supporting interoperability for demand response signals to smart grids. As wireless providers transition toward 5G and optical networks, EMAs are evolving into powerful frameworks of interconnected EMAs associated with cloud and edge computing. This article proposes a hierarchical distributed architecture that combines the advantages of both hierarchical and distributed architectures. A hierarchical architecture provides large-scale information acquisition, communications, processing, and control for cooperative energy management in homes and grids through cloud computing, while a distributed architecture provides autonomous decision making capability with agent-based intelligence through edge computing. The experimental results demonstrate the substantial achievements of the proposed hierarchical distributed EMA framework based on an actual protocol and system implementation.

DFL relies on a network of sensor radars that transmit, receive, and process reflected signals propagating in a monitored environment. The accuracy of DFL degrades in cluttered environments, due to the presence of undesired objects that reflect the signal. Indeed, the multiple reflections of the signal overlap at the receiver and make the inference of targets positions challenging. This article presents a theoretical foundation of DFL in cluttered environments by deriving the fundamental limits on DFL accuracy. In particular, we propose a system model that takes into account multiple reflections, nonline-of-sight conditions, and the presence of multiple targets. Building on such a model, we derive the Cramr-Rao bound on the inference accuracy of targets positions by applying equivalent Fisher information analysis. The proposed bound provides guidelines for the design and analysis of DFL systems operating in cluttered environments. Then, the article presents a case study compliant with the 5G New Radio numerology and channel modeling. Results show how the minimum achievable error is affected by multiple reflections and multiple targets and to which extent the employment of a signal with larger bandwidth and a network with a higher number of receivers can lower the achievable error toward submeter accuracy."",The authors would like to thank R.

While existing schemes keep adding new functionalities (e.g., collaborative computing and caching), they overlook an important issue of establishing trustworthiness among all CEC participants. In general, due to the heterogeneity of all participants, simply assuming trustworthiness among them is undesirable. To address this issue, in this article, we present BlockEdge, a blockchain-powered framework that delivers trusted CEC services. Toward this end, BlockEdge first introduces incentive schemes to attract edge nodes to participate in CEC tasks. Then it publicly and persistently stores all task results on blockchain to enable smart-contract-based correctness verification and automated punishment in case of failures. Such a built-in accountability scheme allows BlockEdge to establish a trust reputation system for all CEC stakeholders, which can be further used for reliable selection of CEC participators. Our security analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate that BlockEdge is both technically feasible and financially beneficial. We hope that the blockchain-based trustworthiness establishment designed in BlockEdge can provide a fundamental primitive for building a more secure collaborative ecosystem, especially for complex networks such as 5G and IoT."",""This work was supported in part by the National Key R&amp";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Introduction. Currently, wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM-PON) are the main structure for building transport domain between the base band head (BBU) and remote radio head (RRH) of 5G mobile access networks. The communication used for this case is classic point-to-multipoint (P2MP): BBU – optical line terminal (OLT) – arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) multiplexers connected by drop and distribution fibers – optical network node (ONU) – RRH. To set up an uplink channel in the ONU, it is necessary to control the transmitter carrier wavelength due to possible installation errors occurred at the initial connection to the OLT (initialization), as well as due to wavelength drift during operation (correction) and aging of the laser source (tuning). To achieve a dense and efficient deployment of RRH stations and easy initialization of their central wavelengths, the ONU includes various types of tunable colorless laser transmitters, providing easy monitoring emission wavelength and its control with the use of various mechanisms. Methods. Based on the analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, there is proposed a procedure for modulation OTDR sounding of the AWG channel with the use of the two-frequency radiation and the three-frequency radiation methods. The first one is induced by the Il’in-Morozov’s method with spacing by the one channel bandwidth at half maximum and the second one is obtained from the two-frequency method by means of the carrier recovery method. To implement the tuning procedures, an externally modulated laser (EML) is used, the position of the wavelength relative to the center of the AWG channel is determined based on the procedures of spectral analysis of the reflected two- or three-component radiation obtained by carrier modulation. Based on the results of their study, a three-frequency OTDR method of determining the ONU laser wavelength, with spectral components unbalanced in amplitude and frequency, was selected to carry out a more thorough study. Findings. There are presented a structural diagram of the system, the developed mathematical model of the tuning process and the results of a numerical experiment on reconstructing the shape of the spectral characteristic of the AWGONU channel for the three-frequency radiation, which is unbalanced in amplitude and difference frequency of its components. The relative error in determining the center wavelength of the spectral characteristic of the AWGONU channel by its maximum amplitude did not exceed 5×10–3 with a given tuning detalization of 2.5 GHz for a 50 GHz AWGONU channel and the dependence of the optical power of the transmitter at 0.02 dB / GHz for the data rate in the uplink 10 Gbps, respectively. Conclusion. The developed system meets the entire requirements for systems of the given class and can be used both for the initialization process when the ONU is turned on, for adjusting the tuning within its daily operation, as well as for retuning after long use of the laser."",,,Vestnik of Volga State University of Technology Series Radio Engineering and Infocommunication Systems,,,,2020-11-18,2020,,2020-11-18,,3(47),66-84,Closed,Article,""Макаров, И.А.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, classical ML exerts severe demands in terms of energy, memory, and computing resources, limiting their adoption for resource-constrained edge devices. The new breed of intelligent devices and high-stake applications (drones, augmented/virtual reality, autonomous systems, and so on) requires a novel paradigm change calling for distributed, low-latency and reliable ML at the wireless network edge (referred to as edge ML). In edge ML, training data are unevenly distributed over a large number of edge nodes, which have access to a tiny fraction of the data. Moreover, training and inference are carried out collectively over wireless links, where edge devices communicate and exchange their learned models (not their private data). In a first of its kind, this article explores the key building blocks of edge ML, different neural network architectural splits and their inherent tradeoffs, as well as theoretical and technical enablers stemming from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.

Mobile-edge computing (MEC) offers a way to shorten the service delay by building small-scale cloud infrastructures at the network edge. By co-locating the BBU pool with edge cloud at the so-called BBU node, we can take full advantages of C-RAN and MEC for better spectrum utilization and delay-guaranteed services. In this article, we first study how to allocate each user’s task to the BBU node and find the path from his/her accessing RRH node to the BBU node such that the maximum service delay among all the requests is minimized. We then consider this problem with survivability concerns, which is to use both primary and backup BBU nodes to issue the request such that the primary path and backup path are link disjoint. We analyze the complexities of these two problems and prove they are NP-hard in general. Subsequently, we devise a randomized approximation algorithm and an efficient heuristic to solve the considered problems, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmark heuristics in terms of acceptance ratio and maximum service delay."",""The work of Song Yang was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 61802018, and in part by the Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars.

Tactical bubbles—ad hoc‐type nonpublic communications networks built with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project‐based mobile technologies—offer mission critical communications services for public safety authorities in areas with bad mobile network coverage while also providing additional capacity in hot spot areas.

The performance and coverage of the tactical bubbles are evaluated in a trial, which represents authorities' search operations in a rural environment with hills, forests, and swamps. The achieved coverage range of the bubbles is more than 1000 m with the unmanned aerial system‐based measurements, whereas by car, the coverage is less than 600 m.

This transition presents a promising opportunity for sustainable energy trading. However, the integration of prosumers in the energy market imposes new considerations in designing unified and sustainable frameworks for efficient use of the power and communication infrastructure. Furthermore, several issues need to be tackled to adequately promote the adoption of decentralized renewable-energy-oriented systems, such as communication overhead, data privacy, scalability, and sustainability. In this article, we present the different aspects and challenges to be addressed for building efficient energy trading markets in relation to communication and smart decision making. Accordingly, we propose a multi-level pro-decision framework for prosumer communities to achieve collective goals. Since the individual decisions of prosumers are mainly driven by individual self-sufficiency goals, the framework prioritizes the individual prosumers' decisions and relies on the 5G wireless network for fast coordination among community members. In fact, each prosumer predicts energy production and consumption to make proactive trading decisions as a response to collective-level requests. Moreover, the collaboration of the community is further extended by including the collaborative training of prediction models using federated learning, assisted by edge servers and prosumer home area equipment. In addition to preserving prosumers' privacy, we show through evaluations that training prediction models using federated learning yields high accuracy for different energy resources while reducing the communication overhead."",The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for financial support of this research.,The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for financial support of this research.,IEEE Wireless Communications,,,,2021-12-01,2021,,2021-12-01,28,6,26-33,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even if the initial 5G networks, basing on the 3GPP Release 15, have hardly started become commercially available gradually as of 2019 and their large-scale deployment is still years away, industry is already keen to envision the justification and performance of the forthcoming generation. While there are no concrete 6G standards produced at this stage, their planning will benefit from realistic indications of the requirements and type of usage. The task is not straightforward as users, including a variety of verticals with their rather different communication environments, are sometimes not capable of expressing their future needs in technical terms nor industry might be able to prognosticate the demand that has not yet equivalence in preceding systems.

"411,pub.1117375035,10.1109/tcss.2019.2919097,,,Mobile Edge Aided Data Dissemination for Wireless Healthcare Systems,""Recent advances in microelectronic technologies have enabled the design and proliferation of low-power wireless networks for autonomously monitoring and control of wireless healthcare systems. In order to control and update the network nodes (e.g., bug fixing, command distribution, software update) in the healthcare system, reliable and efficient data dissemination is one of the key building blocks. However, traditional data dissemination relies mainly on the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and thus much energy is wasted. With the development of 5G communication technologies, especially the mobile edge computing (MEC), it is believed that the edge server will become promising and more pervasively deployed. Despite computational offloading, the edge servers are also capable of communicational offloading. Therefore, to achieve data dissemination in an efficient way, we propose an edge-aided data dissemination system, in which the mobile edge servers are used to disseminate different segments of data objects. After that, IoT nodes exchange segments with each other to collect the entire data objects. In our work, we design the installation mechanism and data propagation protocol to not only ensure integrality of the data objects transmitted but also avoid the transmission conflicts. Furthermore, we design an adaptive protocol to achieve efficient data dissemination for heterogeneous IoT networks. We conduct extensive experiments and large-scale simulations. The results demonstrate that with the help of mobile edge servers, the energy efficiency is significantly improved compared to traditional dissemination approaches."",""This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1400102, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61602095, the National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents of China under Grant BX201700046, and the EU FP7 CLIMBER Project under Grant PIRSES-GA-2013-612652."",,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,,,,2019-06-19,2019,2019-06-19,2019-10-01,6,5,898-906,Closed,Article,""Shu, Chang";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"409,pub.1140888721,10.1002/ett.4351,,,A novel advanced 3D‐IPS based on mmWaves and SOM‐MLP neural network,""Abstract This article proposes a new approach for intelligent indoor 3D positioning that works in the millimeter waves (that constitutes a cornerstone of 5G networks). The solution is based on a combination of a multilayer perceptron network and a self‐organizing map. The solution relies on a precise model of the millimeter frequency channel at 60 GHz and the building of a database of fingerprinting of localization data. The solution approach is based on two parts. In the first part, we specified the target environment for positioning as well as the set of millimeter wave (mmWave) access points (APs) to be deployed in predefined positions. Then, we built a reference database of received signal strengths, azimuths of arrival, and elevations of arrival at each 3D position of the target environment (with a predefined step). The second part of the approach consists of designing a novel neural network architecture that is first trained using the database data and then used to estimate any position in the environment based on the information of the received mmWave signals sent by the different mmWave installed APs. In a normal scenario (without loss of data), the obtained results indicate a millimeter level of the generalization error of the estimated 3D positions. In the case of missing data that may due to potential failures in the system, the obtained accuracy is of the order of 34 cm."",,,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,,,,2021-09-03,2021,2021-09-03,2021-11,32,11,,Closed,Article,""Tamazirt, Lotfi";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The recent evolution of mobile networks (e.g., 5G) has further increased the need for the distribution of accurate and reliable time synchronization, due to wider use of time-division duplex (TDD) techniques and the support of critical infrastructure. The need for time synchronization is increasing in several industries other than telecommunications, as they are building the infrastructure for a smart society. Machine type communications (industrial automation, smart grids, automotive), data centers, network analytics, and finance are some key examples. Accurate location is another key application that often relies on the distribution of accurate timing. Many of these applications require traceability to an official realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The new concept of “time as a service” has been introduced as a method of providing time with some level of guarantees. Evolution of the existing time synchronization techniques, as well as the definition of new solutions, is expected to continue to support existing and future needs of all these industries. Definition of new application areas that can benefit from the availability of accurate and reliable time distribution can be anticipated. This Special Issue of IEEE Communications Magazine provides particularly interesting examples of emerging time synchronization needs across the industry for a smart society, including some examples of how the synchronization methods are evolving to meet the new requirements."",,,IEEE Communications Magazine,,,,2020-04-01,2020,,2020-04-01,58,4,52-52,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, in the previous studies, there are many studies discussing rainfall as a negative because it is a factor in the degradation of buildings. Studies about rainfall as a positive, or as the object of landscape appreciation, have not been plentiful. In Japan, there is much rain season, landscape planning and landscape color plans should have been focusing on rainy landscapes. In this study, rain should be taken into consideration as an important factor in landscape color planning, and the visual effects and impression of colors on façades during rainfall were investigated. Verification experiments were conducted in a rain simulation device that can control rainfall and illuminance. Experiments were conducted based on an experimental design with four factors of hue (5R / 5Y / 5G / 5PB), Chroma, lightness, and rainfall. In the rainfall simulation experiment, the visual effect of the color based on visual colorimetry, and conducted impression evaluations. The findings obtained by the verification are as follows. First, in order to examine the color lightness of the visual effect, visual colorimetry by Value of the color was conducted. It was found that the Value of the color got higher during rainfall. The color Hue (5R/5G/5PB) showed that the lightness effect of the color Value was at its maximum in rainfall 11mm/h, and above that the lightness effect of the color Value began decreasing. At the same time, the color of Hue 5Y showed that the lightness effect of the color Value increased as rainfall increased. Next, in order to examine the color saturation of the visual effect, we conducted visual colorimetry by Chroma of the color. It was found that the Chroma of the color got lower at rainfall. The color of Hue (5Y/5G/5PB) showed that the somber effect of the color Chroma increased with increasing rainfall. Other hand, the color of Hue 5R showed that the somber effect of the color Chroma decreased with increasing rainfall. Also, in order to examine the texture as an impression of color, we evaluated impression. It was found that the color impression became soft during rainfall. It is thought that the lightness of the color increased because of the rainfall, hence softening the texture of the color. Impression was evaluated in order to examine liveliness as an impression of color. By analysis only the color of Hue 5R took on a lively impression at rainfall, with the effect reaching its maximum when rainfall was at 11mm/h. It is thought that the movement of rain changed because of the rainfall, and the color took on a lively impression through its influence. Finally, impression was evaluated to examine the aesthetic sense of colors. It was demonstrated that only the warm color of Hue (5R/5Y) took on a beautiful impression at rainfall. We believe that the movement of rain was changed by the rainfall, and the color took on a beautiful impression by its influence. From our findings, the relationship between rainfalls and the visual effects and impressions of color were confirmed, and there were differences in the evaluation depending on the Hue and the amount of rainfall. In landscape color planning, it was to consider the influence of rainfall is important for a fascinating landscape. This study will show basic important references of such new landscape color plan."",,,Journal of Architecture and Planning (Transactions of AIJ),,,,2019-07-30,2019,2019-07-30,2019,84,761,1569-1578,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To address this question, we show that the peak download data rates for both WiFi and cellular systems have been scaling exponentially with time over the last 25 years. While keeping up with the historic cellular trends will be possible in the near-term with a modest bandwidth and hardware complexity expansion, even a reasonable stretching of this road-map into the far future would require significant bandwidth accretion, perhaps possible at the millimeter wave, sub-millimeter wave, or terahertz regimes. The consequent increase in focus on systems at higher carrier frequencies necessitates a paradigm shift from the reuse of over-simplified (yet mathematically elegant) models, often inherited from sub-6 GHz systems to a more holistic view, where real measurements guide, motivate, and refine the building of relevant but possibly complicated models, solution space(s), and good solutions. To motivate the need for this shift, we illustrate how the traditional abstraction fails to correctly estimate the delay spread of millimeter wave wireless channels and hand blockage losses at higher carrier frequencies. We conclude this paper with a broad set of implications for future research prospects at the physical-layer, including key use-cases, possible research policy initiatives, and structural changes needed in telecommunications departments at universities."",""The authors would like to thank Jung Ryu and Andrzej Partyka for studies on delay spread, and M.

The Ni nanoparticles with an average diameter of 70–80 nm were observed to successfully grow on the GNP surface via SEM and TEM. Both thermally conductive and microwave absorbing properties of the prepared composites were intensively investigated. A reflection loss test experimentally suggested that the PMMA/Ni@GNP composites showed a good microwave absorbing property, among which the composite containing 30 wt % Ni@GNP displayed the best microwave absorption performance (with a value of −30 dB for RL min in the C band). The thermal conduction behavior of the composites was jointly studied by infrared thermal imaging (ITI) and enthalpy transformation method together with a four-parameter model. The average heating rate during an initial stage was obviously found to increase from 65.4 to 103.2 °C/min, indicating that a well-defined heat conduction network gradually formed in the composites, which exerted positive influence on heat conduction. The composites generally bore perfect thermal conductivities (e.g., with a maximum in-plane thermal conductivity of 9.02 W/m·K and a maximum out-of-plane value of 1.29 W/m·K), and the variations of thermal conductivity versus filler loading should be attributed to the construction of an anisotropically thermally conductive network in the composites. The PMMA/Ni@GNP composites with desirable microwave absorption and thermal conductivity would find potential applications in 5G communication devices."",""The authors acknowledge the support from the National Key R&amp";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To secure the devices, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offer a practical solution of secret key generations. Polar codes have been considered in PUF-based key generation schemes to ensure robustness and security. However, we have proven that helper data errors have catastrophic effects on the hard-in min-sum based successive cancellation decoding in the scheme, which leads to decoding failures no matter how strong the polar codes are. In this paper, a new polar-based fuzzy extractor is proposed to securely and robustly generate secret keys from unstable and biased PUF bits. To handle the secrecy leakage caused by bias, we design an OR-based debiasing to control the resulting bias in [2-g,0.5]$$[2-g,0.5]$$, where g$$g$$ is the golden ratio, and then the secrecy leakage caused by the resulting bias is hidden by wiretap polar coset codes. We evaluate the upper bound of the secrecy leakage using the Hamming weights of polar codewords and then determine the length of mask for meeting certain security and robustness requirements. In addition, we give a secure and robust polar construction algorithm for our key generation scheme based on Reed-Muller codes.

These parameters allow us to estimate for each situation occurs at the built-up terrain area the effects of fading, as a source of multiplicative noise.

However, the intrinsic weak impedance match and single dielectric loss domination of this material only produce high-frequency electromagnetic absorption (EMA), which is seemingly futile for the prevalent low-band 4G and 5G EMW. In this study, efforts have been made to effectively texture rod-like TiO2 semiconductor with different mass ratios on the a few layers of WS2 nanosheets via a simple step-by-step hydrothermal method. It is found that the WS2/TiO2 hybrids loaded with 10% TiO2 at a sample thickness of 5.30 mm, the minimum RL is −43.90 dB at 5.12 GHz. When the thickness of the sample is 2.00 mm, the bandwidth with RL value less than −10 dB can reach 4.70 GHz, and the effective EMA band could be adjusted in a range of 13.84 GHz (4.16–18 GHz) by increasing the thickness from 1.0 mm to 5.5 mm. It was found that the introduction of TiO2 nanosheets with high dielectric loss into the dielectric WS2 nanosheets can produce a synergistic effect.

In the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands, directional beamforming is essential to the establishment of an efficient radio link for signal transmission. However, in wireless mobile environments, the effective beam direction is generally unavailable in the initial access phase. Hence, beam alignment (BA) is crucial for link establishment in initial access. In this work, we propose an efficient BA technique, referred to as the multi-modal pattern BA scheme, to improve the performance and efficiency of initial access in massive MIMO systems. Unlike the conventional sequential search scheme using single-modal patterns, the transmission of synchronization signals in the proposed scheme is based on the use of multi-modal patterns, each of which specifies multiple main lobes with distinguishable directions. Incomparison with the conventional scheme, our scheme can greatly enhance the achieved angular resolution after BA under the use of a fixed number of synchronization signals. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the established link is significantly improved. By contrast, if the same angular resolution is desired, the proposed scheme can greatly reduce the number of required synchronization signals to conserve the radio resources, including transmission power and bandwidth, and to decrease the searching delay in the BA procedure.

Multiple connections were required from 10Ghz to 175GHz as well has 30+ DC signal lines. The design can support this level of interconnect density and act as an interposer for next level interconnect to a printed circuit board.

Despite the great efforts that have been put on the construction of spectrum maps, access to accurate and valid spectrum data in dynamically changing environments emphasizes the need for more advanced solutions tailored to such rapidly varying scenarios. To this end, the idea of spectrum map prediction is introduced. In this paper, we address the problem of spectrum map prediction from historical spectrum observations in the dynamically changing environments. The problem is particularly challenging when the available historical spectrum observations are incomplete and corrupted by anomalies. We propose three techniques to solve the problem. First, we combine the spectrum map with prediction functionalities so as to offer a huge potential for efficient resource management and flexible sharing of resources in dynamically changing environments. Second, by fully exploiting the hidden spatial-temporal-spectral structures of the spectrum data and the sparsity of anomalies and missing data, we model the spectrum map as a 3rd-order spectrum tensor and formulate the spectrum map prediction problem as a low-rank tensor completion problem. Third, we design a robust online spectrum map prediction (ROSMP) algorithm based on the alternating direction minimization method, which derives the tensor decomposition factors for a new timeslot based on the update of existing ones rather than re-computing from the scratch. By gradually learning the hidden spatial-temporal-spectral structures of the spectrum data, ROSMP is able to predict and obtain the complete spectrum map with high accuracy. Finally, extensive numerical evaluations using a real spectrum measurement dataset confirm the efficacy and efficiency of ROSMP and show the superiority of ROSMP over the baselines."",""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61771126, in part by the Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2018108, and in part by the U.S. NSF ECCS under Grants 1731238, 2030063, and CCF 2007313."",""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61771126, in part by the Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2018108, and in part by the U.S. NSF ECCS under Grants 1731238, 2030063, and CCF 2007313."",IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,,,,2021-05-19,2021,2021-05-19,,21,12,4583-4594,Closed,Article,""Li, Xi";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Resource constraints associated with a hardware testbed of this breakthrough technology, currently under development, necessitate an interconnect architecture of a Network of Controllers (CN) that is distinct from, yet reminiscent to, those of conventional Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures. To meet the purposes of our HSF testbed, we rationalize the construction of an irregular topology where its controllers are interconnected in a Manhattan-like geometry, with the flow of control directives conducted in a handshaking mode, and routing operated by an XY-YX algorithm that is agnostic of the CN connectivity, determined following the results of model specification and model checking techniques. With such controllers prone to the appearance of permanent faults, threatening the operation of such HSFs, we propose, develop and evaluate two fault adaptive routing algorithms aiming to enhance the successful delivery of packetized control directives to their recipients: (1) Loop Free Algorithm (LFA), and (2) Reliable Delivery Algorithm (RDA) of deterministic and probabilistic variants. LFA and RDA are developed based on utilizing said topology-agnostic XY-YX routing algorithm as a base, along with an appropriate adoption of routing turn rules, to address said HSF CN challenges that deviate from traditional fault tolerant routing algorithms seen in NoCs. Experimental evaluation results obtained using a custom developed simulator, show that probabilistic RDA exhibits top performance in terms of successful packet delivery ratio and topology coverage, albeit at the expense of a higher path hop count.

The principle of clonal node attack is that the attacker captures the legitimate nodes in the network and obtains all their legitimate information, copies several nodes with the same ID and key information, and puts these clonal nodes in different locations in the network to attack the edge computing devices, resulting in network paralysis. How to quickly and efficiently identify clone nodes and isolate them becomes the key to prevent clone node attacks and improve the security of edge computing. In order to improve the degree of protection of edge computing and identify clonal nodes more quickly and accurately, based on edge computing of machine learning, this paper uses case analysis method, the literature analysis method, and other methods to collect data from the database, and uses parallel algorithm to build a model of clonal node recognition. The results show that the edge computing based on machine learning can greatly improve the efficiency of clonal node recognition, the recognition speed is more than 30% faster than the traditional edge computing, and the recognition accuracy reaches 0.852, which is about 50% higher than the traditional recognition.

In contrast to orthogonal schemes, such as OFDMA, NOMA multiplexes several users on the same frequency and time resource. Joint subcarrier and power allocation problems (JSPA) in NOMA are NP-hard to solve in general. In this family of problems, we consider the weighted sum-rate (WSR) objective function as it can achieve various tradeoffs between sum-rate performance and user fairness. Because of JSPA's intractability, a common approach in the literature is to solve separately the power control and subcarrier allocation (also known as user selection) problems, therefore achieving sub-optimal result. In this work, we first improve the computational complexity of existing single-carrier power control and user selection schemes. These improved procedures are then used as basic building blocks to design new algorithms, namely Opt-JSPA, $\varepsilon$-JSPA and Grad-JSPA. Opt-JSPA computes an optimal solution with lower complexity than current optimal schemes in the literature. It can be used as a benchmark for optimal WSR performance in simulations. However, its pseudo-polynomial time complexity remains impractical for real-world systems with low latency requirements. To further reduce the complexity, we propose a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme called $\varepsilon$-JSPA. Since, no approximation has been studied in the literature, $\varepsilon$-JSPA stands out by allowing to control a tight trade-off between performance guarantee and complexity. Finally, Grad-JSPA is a heuristic based on gradient descent. Numerical results show that it achieves near-optimal WSR with much lower complexity than existing optimal methods."",,,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,,,,2020-03-23,2020,2020-03-23,,68,,2215-2230,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using the proposed system, the root handheld device plays the role of an MEC server and is charge of downloading POIs' contents from the remote cloud server using 4G/5G cellular network and then forwarding POIs' contents to other group members' handheld devices using device‐to‐device (D2D) communication. Since the number of connected handheld devices in each handheld device is limited using D2D communication, this work proposed a control scheme called k‐Connection‐Limited and n‐Hop (kCL‐nH) tree topology's construction scheme to achieve the proximate sharing of POIs' contents. Additionally, since the root handheld device consumes more battery power than others, this work proposed a control scheme that has each group member's handheld device to be the root handheld device alternatively. A credit scheme was thus proposed to denote each handheld device's contribution, which is referred for the selecting of the next root handheld device, to achieve the fairness concern. Then, the control scheme, which is executed in the corresponding MEC server, considering both remaining battery power and credit for the switching of the root handheld device was designed. The proposed method was developed using Wi‐Fi Direct over the iOS system.

The paper presents a brief description of the biological effects of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation and shows basic mechanisms of the negative effect on the most vulnerable organs and systems. Our objective was to evaluate valid guidelines for measuring electromagnetic radiations of the radio frequency range in residential areas, in houses and public buildings. Materials and methods: We reviewed specific characteristics of cellular base and radio relay stations, compared and described electromagnetic radiation measuring devices. The provided recommendations for their selection were based on frequencies at which the communication equipment operates. We also analyzed the current guidelines with account for characteristics of transmitting radio equipment of cellular base stations and the applied measuring instruments. Results: The results of assessing established significant differences are discussed. The analysis of the requirements for measurements demonstrated significant discrepancies and contradictions between the valid documents. The evaluation results demonstrated impossibility of simultaneous measurements of electromagnetic radiation from cellular BS and RRS due to violations of requirements for measurement procedures.

A characteristic of mMIMO is beamforming in which a large array of antenna elements is used to concentrate energy in specific narrow directions to improve data throughput. Assessing the electromagnetic field (EMF) compliance boundary around a beamforming capable mMIMO antenna using a traditional approach that assumes maximum power is simultaneously transmitted in every possible direction and the radio base station (RBS) is fully loaded (100% traffic utilization) may produce very conservative results. In this study we report on measurements of the 6-minute time-averaged EMF levels in front of a mMIMO antenna operating in a 4G LTE time division duplex (TDD) network and compare results with conservatively computed EMF levels. The RBS serves users scattered throughout a dense urban environment characterized by low rise commercial/industrial buildings. When scaled to 100% RBS traffic loading and taking TDD operation into account, the highest measured EMF level was 7.3% to 16.1% of the ICNIRP occupational reference level compared to a conservative computed level of 79.3%. This represents a far-field reduction in the occupational compliance boundary of between 2.2 and 3.3 times and is consistent with other statistically based theoretical studies. An additional reduction in the compliance boundary can be expected due to actual RBS traffic loading often being much less than 100%."",""The authors acknowledge the very helpful technical assistance and access to equipment provided by Airmet Scientific Melbourne, Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science Agency (ARPANSA), and Telstra Corporation Ltd.

The Gram–Schmidt procedure is a well-known method for orthogonalization of a basis of a vector space, which can represent signal constructions in different signal processing applications. A supplementation for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, which allows controlling the correlations between signal components in a system of signals in condition of equality of these correlations, is justified and formalized in the paper. The presented solution is performed by methods of linear algebra using transformations of signals when representing them in vector spaces. The formation of a new system of non-orthogonal vectors, which corresponds to a system of correlated signals, is implemented through additive transformations in a system of orthogonal vectors, which corresponds to a system of non-correlated signals, after the Gram–Schmidt procedure. The proposed calculation procedure contains an additional interior parameter, which depends both on the number of signal components and on correlations between them. An evaluation procedure for the value of this parameter is formalized and analyzed in the paper. The calculation procedure is adapted for stochastic signals and their processing, which takes into account standard deviations for evaluation of norms of vectors when representing signals in vector spaces. The solution for the synthesis of systems of correlated signals is characterized by a suitable algorithmic and computational complexity, which is important for its practical implementation in real-time signal processing applications.

Due to the sparse nature of mmWave channel, several users may choose the same beam as the strongest one, leading to severe intra-beam interference (intra-BI). Although intra-BI can be mitigated through digital precoding, the required number of RF chains for fulfilling massive connectivity becomes large. By applying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and properly allocating transmit power to each beam and user, the sum rate can be maximized using a smaller number of RF chains. However, the power allocated to each user depends on that allocated to other users within the same beam. Since the joint beam selection and power allocation problem contains a non-convex objective function with a large set of coupled and mixed integer variables, direct solutions may not exist particularly when both the number of users and antennas are large. In this work, we decompose the aforementioned problem into two subproblems, where the beam selection sub-problem is first solved under an equal power allocation. The outcome of beam selection is then used as the input to the power allocation sub-problem. For both subproblems, we develop numerous efficient algorithms to find the active beam set and the user power allocation, respectively. The notions of embedded methods from machine learning and that of intelligent searching from metaheuristics are adopted in our work as the key ingredient for algorithm constructions. Numerical results demonstrate that in the region of large user population, the proposed beam selection and power allocation algorithms can effectively improve the sum rate using a less number of RF chains in comparison with some existing solutions."",""This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant MOST 107-2628-E-006-002-MY3, and in part by the Qualcomm through the Taiwan University Research Collaboration Project."",,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-03-16,2020-01-01,8,,53868-53882,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To support this dynamicity, flex-grid elastic optical networks (EONs) have started to become prolific over the past few years. During the migration from the legacy fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing optical networks to flex-grid EONs, a transition technology called the fixedflex-grid optical network has become popular. In such fixedflex-grid networks, the energy consumption caused by serious capacity mismatch between variable IP traffic and the different optical channel capacities is significantly high to be ignored. In fact, energy-efficient traffic grooming (i.e., to aggregate multiple fine-grained IP flows and map them onto a lightpath) is a challenge in IP-over-fixedflex-grid optical networks because co-existing fixed-grid and flex-grid nodes have different traffic grooming ability and energy consumption models. To overcome the challenge, we propose an auxiliary-graph-based energy-efficient traffic-grooming (EETG) algorithm in IP-over-fixedflex-grid optical networks for the first time. The construction of an auxiliary graph (AG) model for each connection request is one of the core steps. The well-designed weight-assignment scheme of the AG establishes the relationships between traffic grooming operations and specific energy consumption models. The final traffic grooming operations are undertaken based on the calculated weight-minimized path. The simulation results show that the EETG algorithm achieves 1) the least energy consumption compared with the state-of-the-art traffic grooming algorithms under the non-blocking scenario";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To achieve ultra-fast software implementations, the basic design strategy is to take full advantage of the AES-NI and SIMD instructions as that of the AEGIS family and Tiaoxin-346. Although Jean and Nikolić have generalized the way to construct efficient round functions using only one round of AES (aesenc) and 128-bit XOR operation and have found several efficient candidates, there still seems to exist potential to further improve it regarding speed and state size. In order to minimize the critical path of one round, we remove the case of applying both aesenc and XOR in a cascade way for one round. By introducing a cost-free block permutation in the round function, we are able to search for candidates in a larger space without sacrificing the performance. Consequently, we obtain more efficient constructions with a smaller state size than candidates by Jean and Nikolić. Based on the newly-discovered round function, we carefully design the corresponding AEAD scheme with 256-bit security by taking several reported attacks on the AEGIS family and Tiaxion-346 into account. Our AEAD scheme can reach 138Gbps which is 4 times faster than the AEAD scheme of SNOW-V. Rocca is also much faster than other efficient schemes with 256-bit key length, e.g. AEGIS-256 and AES-256-GCM.

In this paper, we address several technical challenges towards its practical implementation for beyond 5G systems. To this end, we focus on a single-cell system with a multi-antenna base station (BS) and $K$ single-antenna receivers. We consider RS in its most general form with $2^{K}-1$ streams, and joint decoding to fully exploit the potential of RS. First, we investigate the achievable rates under joint decoding and formulate the precoder design problems to maximize a general utility function, or to minimize the transmit power under pre-defined rate targets. Building upon the concave-convex procedure (CCCP), we propose precoder design algorithms for an arbitrary number of users. Our proposed algorithms approximate the intractable non-convex problems with a number of successively refined convex problems, and provably converge to stationary points of the original problems. Then, to reduce the decoding complexity, we consider the optimization of the precoder and the decoding order under successive decoding. Further, we propose a stream selection algorithm to reduce the number of precoded signals. With a reduced number of streams and successive decoding at the receivers, our proposed algorithm can even be implemented when the number of users is relatively large, whereas the complexity was previously considered as prohibitively high in the same setting. Finally, we propose a simple adaptation of our algorithms to account for the imperfection of the channel state information at the transmitter.

This article presents a comprehensive survey of the integration of blockchain technologies for securing SAG-IoT applications. Specifically, we first discuss the architecture, characteristics, and security threats of SAG-IoT systems. Then, we concentrate on the promising blockchain-based solutions for SAG-IoT security. Next, we discuss the critical challenges when integrating blockchain in SAG-IoT security services and review the state-of-the-art solutions. We further investigate the opportunities of blockchain in artificial intelligence and beyond 5G networks and provide open research directions for building future blockchain-empowered SAG-IoT systems."",""This work was supported in part by NSFC under Grant U20A20175 and Grant U1808207, and in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities."",,IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials,,,,2021-12-01,2021,2021-12-01,2022-01-01,24,1,160-209,Closed,Article,""Wang, Yuntao";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

What it won't have are the endless streams of telephone poles and wires that cascade across other continents. Development experts call this an example of a “leapfrog technology.” By going straight to mobile, many African nations will be able to skip the step of building extensive and expensive landline infrastructure. In fact, “some places will go straight to 5G,” says Vincent Kaabunga, chair of the IEEE Ad Hoc Committee on Africa, which has helped craft IEEE's strategy to increase engineering capacity on the continent. With this kind of leapfrogging, African nations can take the lead in certain types of technological development and deployment, he says. Just look at mobile money: Companies such as M-Pesa sprang up to solve a local problem-people's lack of access to brick-and-mortar banks- and became a way for people not only to make payments, but also to get loans and insurance. “We've refined the concept of mobile money over the last 10 or 15 years,” says Kaabunga, “while other parts of the world are just now coming around to embracing it.” IEEE and its members in Africa are facilitating the application of new technologies by promoting education and access, says Kaabunga, who also works for a technology consulting firm in Kampala, Uganda. The IEEE in Africa Strategy, launched in 2017, calls for IEEE to support engineering education at every level and to advise government policymakers, efforts that Kaabunga and his colleagues in the region have already begun. For example, they're currently working with the Smart Africa alliance, an initiative that aims to create standard policies for information and communications technology to enable a single digital marketplace across the continent."",,,IEEE Spectrum,,,,2019-05-01,2019,,2019-05-01,56,5,4-4,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition with smart city, concepts of smart traffic systems and smart health are also being developed. Combining the above two, smart navigation system for ambulances is being coined. When critical patients are referred by an ambulance, there is a lot of time wastage in facilitation of information and the hospital is completely unaware of the patient’s parameters who is arriving beforehand. Therefore, patient monitor and ambulance tracking system is an efficient system used to carry out a quick thirty-second diagnosis using heartbeat, temperature, breath rate sensors to record vital patient parameters required initially by the doctors to start any treatment and remotely transmit these parameters over wireless medium to the hospital even before the ambulance is deployed. The patient also gets an instant way to request an ambulance on touch of a button without having to call up the hospital and also instantly send a short message service (SMS) to an emergency contact giving both the hospital and contact necessary emergency details a lot earlier. This saves a lot of time, each second of which is important to the patient at life risk. The patient can keep a track of the ambulance’s location, which gives them an idea of its arrival and can also get instant navigation toward the nearest hospital for themselves if need be. The device can be kept with the patient and also installed inside the ambulance. The device enables the use of IoT sensors and android applications for better user interaction and efficient information transmission. The model dictated here is potentially outperformed with easiness and in a better way toward smart healthcare monitoring services."",,,The Journal of Supercomputing,,,,2021-04-06,2021,2021-04-06,2021-11,77,11,12230-12255,Closed,Article,""Poongodi, M.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"363,pub.1127559425,10.1149/ma2020-01241391mtgabs,,,(Keynote) Fully-Depleted SOI Technology for High-Power RF Applications,""FDSOI has shown its benefits, compared to other planar bulk technologies, in low power applications by a better electrostatic control, a reduction in leakage currents and device variability. Thanks to the isolation box in the substrate and the intrinsic channel, the parasitic capacitances are also reduced significantly, including the capacitance between source and drain, and between drain and body. These features help to boost the transistors’ RF performance. The published data shows the measured fT (cut-off frequency) and fMAX (maximum oscillation frequency) of RFMOS in FDSOI processes reach 400 GHz, which is the highest among all advanced CMOS nodes. Moreover, by the process construction (gate-first vs. gate-last), the gate resistance of the transistors in FDSOI processes is smaller, which is beneficial to their RF noise performance. These benefits have been used for small-signal RF blocks in Front-end modules, e.g. LNA, VCO and mixers. In this work, the FDSOI capability for the large-signal RF blocks consisting of integrated power amplifiers (PA) is explored. In previous mobile generations (3G/4G), the base stations need to deliver the peak power more than 100 W, which is solely enabled by GaN or GaAs technologies. Their corresponding handsets also need to transmit a few Watts, which is out of the reach of CMOS-based PA. By moving to massive MIMO with a large number of antennas, the power per RF PA is reduced significantly for both base-stations and handsets in 5G network, with the PMAX per PA varying from 20 dBm to 25 dBm. Such sub-Watt power range opens the opportunities for making silicon-based RF PA, enabling a much larger scale of RF Front-end modules integration. In this paper, two key aspects to make the FDSOI process possible for high-power RF applications in 5G are presented. First, it shows the development of critical active and passive components of high-breakdown and high RF-performance. Second, the 4-port RF test structure designs and in-house characterization to explore the capability of back-bias on RF performance are discussed. Regarding the high-voltage transistors, 3.3V and 5V RF LDMOS have been designed and fabricated without any additional dedicated mask in a sub-28nm FDSOI process. The device was constructed in a non-SOI area. A record high RF-performance, with fT larger than 50 GHz for 5V LDMOS and 100 GHz for 3.3V device, has been achieved. For passive elements, 7V fringe capacitators, inductors and transformers have been developed. The fringe capacitors show their robustness at 7V, with best-in-class quality factor at both 5 GHz and 30 GHz. The matching performance of these capacitors are comparable to the best MOM capacitor mismatch performance in other modern CMOS technologies, which makes them also suitable for high-precision signal processing and filtering. Inductors and transformers have been designed in top 3 metal layers to have state-of-the-art quality factors. An excellent matching between RF measurements and EM simulations has been obtained for these passive elements. Such matching proves that the performance of the passive devices is very well predictable, enabling full design optimization for fringe capacitors and transformers / inductors. To capture the impact of back-bias on RF performance, and facilitate the RF model against silicon validation in the presence of back-bias, this paper shows a 4-port test structure design (GSGSG). The RF measurements for an RFMOS with a back-bias varying from strong reverse to forward are discussed. These results initiate various scenarios for using back-bias in RF applications, e.g. reducing the supply voltage to have the same RF performance, or extending the maximum current density at the same peak fT to have enough RF power. In summary, this paper shows the development of high-voltage RF active and passive devices in a sub-28nm FDSOI process, which are required for building integrated RF power amplifiers at Watt-level in high-performance cost-effective RF front-end ICs. The 3.3V / 5V RF-LDMOS with a cutoff frequency beyond 100GHz has been achieved in silicon, which brings a breakthrough for RF PA designs, both at sub-6GHz and 28GHz. For passive devices, by combining the novel RF design with an RF-compatible metal stack and accurate EM simulation, a record high Q-factor for a 7V-fringe capacitor, a 2-way transformer and 8-shaped inductors are obtained. The developed 4-port measurement for GSGSG structures has been proven as an indispensable tool for RF-FDSOI. These results show FDSOI process can be comparable to RF-HV-centric non-CMOS processes, e.g. SiGe and GaAs, for Watt-level power RF applications."",,,ECS Meeting Abstracts,,,,2020-05-01,2020,,2020-05-01,MA2020-01,24,1391-1391,Closed,Article,""Dinh, Thanh Viet"",""Dinh, Thanh Viet (NXP Semiconductors)"",,""Dinh, Thanh Viet (NXP Semiconductors)"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127559425,""40 Engineering";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the meantime, the volume of data generated at the edge networks is also increasing rapidly. Under this circumstance, building energy-efficient and privacy-protected communications is imperative for 5G and beyond wireless communication systems. The recent emerging distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) perform well in improving resource efficiency while protecting user privacy with low communication overhead. Specifically, FL enables edge devices to learn a shared network model by aggregating local updates while keeping all the training processes on local devices. This paper investigates distributed power allocation for edge users in decentralized wireless networks with aim to maximize energy/spectrum efficiency while preventing privacy leakage based on a FL framework. Due to the dynamics and complexity of wireless networks, we adopt an on-line Actor-Critic (AC) architecture as the local training model, and FL performs cooperation for edge users by sharing the gradients and weightages generated in the Actor network. Moreover, in order to resolve the over-fitting problem caused by data leakages in Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-i.i.d) data environment, we propose a federated augmentation mechanism with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) algorithm for data augmentation. Federated augmentation empowers each device to replenish the data buffer using a generative model of WGANs until accomplishing an i.i.d training dataset, which significantly reduces the communication overhead in distributed learning compared to direct data sample exchange method. Numerical results reveal that the proposed federated learning based cooperation and augmentation (FL-CA) algorithm possesses a good convergence property, high robustness and achieves better accuracy of power allocation strategy than other three benchmark algorithms."",""This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871099 and Grant 61631005, and in part by the Research and Development Program in Key Areas of Guangdong Province under Grant 2018B010114001."",,IEEE Access,,,,2020-01-01,2020,2020-03-09,2020-01-01,8,,48088-48100,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this work, the construction of non-orthogonal space–frequency block codes (NSFBC) from ( n , k ) cyclic codes has been proposed. In which, n represents the number of symbols in the codeword and k represents the number of symbols in the information sequence. The performance of proposed codes has been evaluated in MIMO systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and index modulation (MIMO-OFDM-IM). We initially obtained ( n , k ) full rank cyclic codes for any 1 < k < ⌊ n m ⌋ using Galois field Fourier transform (GFFT) description of ( n , k ) cyclic codes over F q m . Further, NSFBCs are obtained from full rank codes using Rank preserving maps. In a 2 × 2 system and a 10-path MIMO channel, the proposed full rank NSFBC with rank-preserving IM mapping (FR-NSFBC-IM), over F 5 2 , provides he similar BER performance when compared to MIMO-OFDM-IM system with Rate-1 Alamouti code and QPSK. Moreover, it provides an improvement in spectral efficiency of about 0.9 b/s/Hz. When compared to the MIMO-OFDM-IM with BPSK, FR-NSFBC-IM codes over F 5 2 provide an asymptotic SNR gain of about 1 dB and also the spectral efficiency has been improved by about 0.6 b/s/Hz. In the 4 × 4 scenario, full rank NSFBCs over F 5 4 with rank deficient IM mapping (RD-NSFBC-IM) provide an improvement in spectral efficiency of about 1.3 b/s/Hz.

Under strong background noises, the proposed scheme improves the recognition rate of primary users (PUs) than that of the current blind spectrum sensing. First, the ratio of the maximum-to-minimum eigenvalue of a covariance matrix obtained by the Cholesky decomposition is used to construct the statistics. Second, the statistics are labeled with “+1” or “−1,” namely, the energy characteristics of the training samples are extracted and marked with “+1” for PUs and “−1” for noises. Finally, an RBF-SVM classification model, with an intelligent RBF as the SVM kernel function, is obtained by training the above-mentioned statistics and the labels. Thus, the received signals are classified as PUs or not be trained in the SVM model. The threshold possesses self-learning ability, and it distinguishes PU signals from noises effectively. The classification among PU signals and noises is implemented by the optimal SVM decision boundary, derived from maximizing the margin of the decision boundary of trained samples for efficient detection. In addition, the complexity of the statistic construction is lower than that of the conventional maximum minimum eigenvalue (MME). The simulation results show that the RBF in our scheme has 77.5% accuracy at −10 dB, and it outperforms linear kernel function significantly by about 27.5% in accuracy at −10 dB. In addition, the average error probability of the proposed scheme is reduced by about 26% when compared with those of original SVM schemes at −20 dB. The proposed scheme also outperforms the current MME detection in detection probability over 10% at −20 dB. Therefore, the proposed blind spectrum sensing scheme can be efficiently used to detect the PUs by the covariance matrix Cholesky decomposition and the RBF-SVM decision classification in the fifth-generation (5G) communications, especially at low SNRs."",""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1809201, the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant LY17F010019, the Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Plan Project under Grant LGG18F010011 and Grant LGG19F010004, and the Open Project of the Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang, China, under Grant IPCAN-1802."",,IEEE Access,,,,2019-01-01,2019,2019-07-16,2019-01-01,7,,97117-97129,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Motivated by the hard delay requirement for URLLC, we aim at devising medium access control (MAC) schemes that can guarantee packet transmissions within a bounded delay. The model we considered is a multi-channel single-hop ad hoc network in which each node has packets to broadcast to other nodes. This broadcast scenario is common, and has been extensively studied in various scenarios such as safety message broadcast in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Most of the existing MAC schemes employ backoff algorithms to handle transmission failures caused by channel collisions, and thus cannot provide a hard guarantee on transmission delay. Moreover, these schemes rely on time synchronization and coordination among the nodes, which would cause heavy overhead for control message exchange. In this paper, we focus on devising MAC schemes to provide a hard guarantee on broadcast delay, without time synchronization and cooperation among the nodes. We employ the sequence scheme in which each node is pre-assigned a periodic sequence to schedule transmissions and receptions at each time slot. These sequences are referred to as schedule sequences. Since each node starts its transmission schedule independently, there exist relative time offsets among the schedule sequences they use. Previous sequence schemes for broadcast are only conducted in the single channel context. Our objective is to design schedule sequences such that in a multi-channel system, each node can transmit at least one packet to each of its neighbors successfully within a common period, no matter what the time offsets are. The sequence period should be designed as short as possible. In this paper, we analyze the lower bound on sequence period, and propose a sequence construction method by which the period can achieve the same order as the lower bound. We also consider the random scheme in which each node transmits or receives on a channel at each time slot with a pre-determined probability. The frame length and broadcast completion time under different schemes are compared by numerical studies."",""This work was supported in part by Schneider Electric, Lenovo Group (China) Limited and the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund ITS/066/17FP under Grant HKUST-MIT Research Alliance Consortium, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62071236, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China No. 30920021127, and in part by the University Development Fund Research Start-Up Fund UDF01000918 from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen."",,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,,,2021-04-19,2021,2021-04-19,,70,5,4767-4783,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since the amount of computation required for the inference process of the neural network is large, it is processed not by the data acquisition location like a surveillance camera but by the server with abundant computing power installed in the data center. Edge computing is getting considerable attention to solve this problem. However, edge computing can provide limited computation resources. Therefore, we assumed a divided/distributed neural network model using both the edge device and the server. By processing part of the convolution layer on edge, the amount of communication becomes smaller than that of the sensor data. In this paper, we have evaluated AlexNet and the other eight models on the distributed environment and estimated FPS values with Wi-Fi, 3G, and 5G communication. To reduce communication costs, we also introduced the compression process before communication. This compression may degrade the object recognition accuracy. As necessary conditions, we set FPS to 30 or faster and object recognition accuracy to 69.7% or higher. This value is determined based on that of an approximation model that binarizes the activation of Neural Network. We constructed performance and energy models to find the optimal configuration that consumes minimum energy while satisfying the necessary conditions. Through the comprehensive evaluation, we found that the optimal configurations of all nine models. For small models, such as AlexNet, processing entire models in the edge was the best. On the other hand, for huge models, such as VGG16, processing entire models in the server was the best. For medium-size models, the distributed models were good candidates. We confirmed that our model found the most energy efficient configuration while satisfying FPS and accuracy requirements, and the distributed models successfully reduced the energy consumption up to 48.6%, and 6.6% on average.

These transistors operate in the regime when the electron mean free path for collisions with impurities or lattice vibrations exceeds the device dimension. One new feature of this mode of transport is “ballistic mobility” replacing the conventional mobility and being proportional to the channel length. At high frequencies, the electron inertia in short channel devices plays a dominant role and the waves of the electron density (plasma waves) enable the device response well into the terahertz (THz) range of frequencies. Excitation and rectification of the plasma waves enables numerous application in terahertz sensing and communications. Terahertz sensing enables detection of biological and chemical hazardous agents, cancer detection, detection of mines and explosives, provides security in buildings, airports, and other public spaces, and widely used for industry quality control and radio astronomy applications. A new emerging application is for cyber hardware security to distinguish between faked and genuine VLSI chips and predict the VLSI reliability. THz communications, extensively explored since the beginning of the 21-st century, will enable very high data rates (over 430 GPS demonstrated for the W-band) for applications such as driverless cars, autonomous tactical networking with ground and aerial vehicles, and 4K video and cloud storage applications.

"                  The 5G mobile communication system is coming with a main objective, known also as IMT-2020, that intends to increase the current data rates up to several gigabits per second. To meet an accompanying demand of the super high-speed encryption, EIA and EEA algorithms face some challenges. The 3GPP standardization organization expects to increase the security level to 256-bit key length, and the international cryptographic field responds actively in cipher designs and standard applications. SNOW-V is such a proposal offered by the SNOW family design team, with a revision of the SNOW 3G architecture in terms of linear feedback shift register (LFSR) and finite state machine (FSM), where the LFSR part is new and operates eight times the speed of the FSM, consisting of two shift registers and each feeding into the other, and the FSM increases to three 128-bit registers and employs two instances of full AES encryption round function for update. It takes a 128-bit IV, employs 896-bit internal state and produces 128-bit keystream blocks. The result is competitive in pure software environment, making use of both AES-NI and AVX acceleration instructions. Thus, the security evaluation of SNOW-V is essential and urgent, since there is scarcely any definite security bound for it. In this paper, we propose a byte-based guess-and-determine attack on SNOW-V with complexity $2^{406}$ using only seven keystream blocks. We first improve the heuristic guessing-path auto-searching algorithm based on dynamic programming by adding initial guessing set, which is iteratively modified by sieving out the unnecessary guessing variables, in order to correct the guessing path according to the cipher structure and finally launch smaller guessing basis. For the specific design, we split all the computing units into bytes and rewrite all the internal operations correspondingly. We establish a backward-clock linear equation system according to the circular construction of the LFSR part. Then we further simplify the equations to adapt to the input requirements of the heuristic guessing-path auto-searching algorithm. Finally, the derived guessing path needs modification for the pre-simplification and post-reduction. This is the first complete guess-and-determine attack on SNOW-V as well as the first specific security evaluation to the full cipher."",""National Natural Science Foundation of China (61902030, 61772517)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In many ways, the speed of information transmission in such systems limits the signal level provided by the base station in the entire operating band of the Internet signal. Since the antenna located on the wall of the house is stationary, it can be made relatively large, which allows you to implement a higher gain and accordingly increase the signal level on the router. At the same time, the market for such antennas is quite saturated with a wide variety of antenna designs, but due to the increase in the number of people working in remote mode and the expected transition to mobile communication systems 5G, it still continues to develop rapidly. The paper proposes a new design of the transceiver mobile Internet antenna-buster, whose main advantage is absolute imperceptibility when installed outdoors. We consider a planar in-phase 8-element antenna array installed on the window glass of a suburban building. As the individual emitters of the lattice are encouraged to use a planar wave dipoles. A feeding scheme for the antenna array on flat two-wire lines has been developed, which provides in-phase and almost equal amplitude excitation of all array elements of the array. Calculations of antenna radiation patterns in the range of 1700-2700 MHz are given. It is shown that the developed antenna has a gain of 8-9 dB in the range of 1700-2100 MHz and 10-12 dB in the range of 2400-2700 MHz. These values are practically not inferior to similar indicators of known collinear antenna arrays and in the upper part of the work range, they have a gain of 1-2 dB compared to their analogs. A planar array matching scheme has been developed that provides a VSWR of about 2.5 in the range of 1700-2100 MHz and no worse than 2 in the range of 2400-2700 MHz.

"309,pub.1118009277,10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101949,,,Towards scalable Community Networks topologies,""Community Networks (CNs) are grassroots bottom-up initiatives that build local infrastructures, normally using Wi-Fi technology, to bring broadband networking in areas with inadequate offer of traditional infrastructures such as ADSL, FTTx or wide-band cellular (LTE, 5G). Albeit they normally operate as access networks to the Internet, CNs are ad-hoc networks that evolve based on local requirements and constraints, often including additional local services on top of Internet access. These networks grow in highly decentralized manner that radically deviates from the top-down network planning practiced in commercial mobile networks, depending, on the one hand, on the willingness of people to participate, and, on the other hand, on the feasibility of wireless links connecting the houses of potential participants with each other. In this paper, we present a novel methodology and its implementation into an automated tool, which enables the exercise of (light) centralized control to the dynamic and otherwise spontaneous CN growth process. The goal of the methodology is influencing the choices to connect a new node to the CN so that it can grow with more balance and to a larger size. Input to our methodology are open source resources about the physical terrain of the CN deployment area, such as Open Street Map and very detailed (less than 1 m resolution) LIDAR-based data about buildings layout and height, as well as technical descriptions and pricing data about off-the-shelf networking devices that are made available by manufacturers. Data related to demographics can be easily added to refine the environment description. With these data at hand, the tool can estimate the technical and economic feasibility of adding new nodes to the CN and actively assist new CN users in selecting proper equipment and CN node(s) to connect with to improve the CN scalability. We test our methodology in four different areas representing standard territorial characterization categories: urban, suburban, intermediate, and rural. In all four cases our tool shows that CNs scale to much larger size using the assisted, network-aware methodology when compared with de facto practices. Results also show that the CNs deployed with the assisted methodology are more balanced and have a lower per-node cost for the same per-node guaranteed bandwidth. Moreover, this is achieved with fewer devices per node, which means that the network is cheaper to build and easier to maintain."",,""This work was financed partially by the European Commission, H2020-ICT-2015 Programme, Grant Number 688768 “netCommons” (Network Infrastructure as Commons).

The demonstrated MMWoF link exhibits superior immunity to the residual frequency and phase noises as well as the inter-carrier interference induced by the free-running dual-mode carrier. For back-to-back optical downstream wireline transmission, the receiving GFDM data optimizes its bit error rate (BER) to 2.2104 by adjusting the bias current of the dual-mode VCSEL to 8 mA (3 Ith), and by grouping the GFDM data matrix with total symbols of N KM with K 2 subcarriers and M 24 timeslots. After a long-reach delivering the optical data stream over 50-km dispersion-managed single-mode fiber (DM-SMF), the qualified receiving power sensitivity is 12 dBm, whereas the decoding GFDM data reveals improved receiving sensitivity with an extremely low power penalty of only 0.3 dB. For the wireless transmission after optical downstream receiving at the remote node, the self-heterodyned MMW carrier exhibits peak power of 62.3 dBm and carrier-to-noise (CNR) of 26.8 dB over long-reach 50-km DM-SMF downstream optical link. In comparison with the mutual heterodyned from two incoherent optical carriers, the self-heterodyned frequency fluctuation can be suppressed from >500 to <330 MHz with significantly suppressed phase noise. After wireless delivering over 2 m in free space, the self-heterodyne down-conversion by power envelope detection guarantees the down-converted quadrature amplitude modulation GFDM (QAM-GFDM) data stream with an average power of -48.4 dBm after optimizing the impedance matching by selecting the appropriate frequency response of the power envelope detector. As a result, the wireless MMW transmission of 8-Gbits 4-QAM GFDM data stream is qualified with error vector magnitude (EVM) of 16.9, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8.5 dB, and BER of 3.8103. By combining the free-running dual-mode source with two advanced techniques including mode-power equalization and self-heterodyned power envelope detection, the proposed synthesizer-free MMWoF network has demonstrated excellent immunity to the phasefrequency noise, inter-carrier interference which is particularly suitable for building up the compact and simplified optical transmitter and microwave receiver modules with cost-effective MMW self-heterodyne scheme."",""This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grants MOST 107-2221-E-002-159-MY3, MOST 107-2221-E-002-158-MY3, MOST 109-2224-E-992-001-, MOST 109-2124-M-009-010-, and MOST 109-2221-E-002-184-MY3."",,Journal of Lightwave Technology,,,,2021-07-13,2021,2021-07-13,,39,19,6076-6084,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Intermodalization of a tank container predetermines its load in various operating conditions depending on the type of vehicle on which it is carried: aviation, sea, air or rail. The analysis of the operating conditions of tank containers, as well as the regulatory documents governing their workload, led to the conclusion that the most dynamic loads acting on the supporting structures during transportation by rail. Namely, during the maneuvering collision of a wagon-platform, on which there are tank containers. In this case, it is stipulated that for a loaded tank container, the dynamic load is assumed to be 4g, and for an empty (for the purpose of checking the reinforcement) – 5g. It is important to note that when the tank container is underfilled with bulk cargo and taking into account movements of fittings relative to fittings, the maximum value of dynamic load can reach significantly larger values. Therefore, in order to ensure the strength of tank containers, an improvement of their structures has been proposed by introducing elastic-viscous bonds into the fittings.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To determine the dynamic loading of the tank container, taking into account the improvement measures, mathematical models have been compiled, taking into account the presence of elastic, viscous and elastic-viscous bonds between the fittings, stops and fittings. It is established that the elastic bond does not fully compensate for the dynamic loads acting on the tank container. The results of mathematical modeling of dynamic loading, taking into account the presence of viscous and elastic-viscous coupling in the fittings, made it possible to conclude that the maximum accelerations per tank container do not exceed the normalized values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"302,pub.1130454795,10.1002/mmce.22404,,,Spectral efficiency enhancement using an antenna‐based orthogonal frequency division multiaccess technique,""An approach to enhance antenna spectral efficiency is proposed based on combining spacetime electromagnetic (EM) models of Tx/Rx antennas with orthogonal frequency division multiaccess (OFDM), leading to the EM‐OFDM, a technology capable of removing intersymbol interference (ISI) in high‐data rate communication links caused by the EM‐induced distortion antenna effects. The proposed approach differs from traditional OFDM in wireless communication in several aspects. First, the technique suggests a new decoupling approach by treating each given antenna transreceive device pair as a “stand‐alone channel” with its own distortion mechanisms considered separately from the propagation channel. Moreover, the deterministic distortion caused by the nonflat pure antenna EM filtration effects is exploited to carefully design a specialized OFDM transmission techniques based on the antenna parameters, not the multipath fading channels often invoked in conventional uses of OFDM methods. (The EM‐OFDM, however, can be combined with a traditional OFDM later if fading channels are present.) In this manner, a more efficient implementation of the wireless link equalization strategy may be enacted since the EM antenna origin of ISI is very different from the traditional propagation channel one. As a proof of concept, the proposed EM‐OFDM method is implemented for a single‐input‐single‐output link comprised of half‐wavelength linear wire antennas. A careful use of finite difference time‐domain to provide EM data allowed the construction of 64 decoupled “pure antenna OFDM subchannels.” Simulation results suggests that the antenna‐based OFDM system is capable of completely neutralizing all ISI effects caused by the limited antenna matching bandwidth of the transreceive wires, therefore, supporting considerably higher data rates with low symbol error rate (SER). A concrete evaluation of the SER using quadrature phase‐shift keying (QPSK) digital carrier modulation resulted in an increase of the effective antenna digital communication spectral efficiency by ratios up to 300%. Moreover, the EM‐OFDM error rate was found to be close to the ideal QPSK level or the maximum possible theoretical limit. Thus, combining detailed EM knowledge with standard signal processing methods can lead to considerable improvement in system design without modifying the antenna physical layout. The proposed approach is expected to play a role in the forthcoming 5G/6G and millimetre wave technology systems currently under development where there is a trend toward integration of EM and digital signal processing at the physical layer level."",,,International Journal of RF and Microwave Computer-Aided Engineering,,,,2020-08-30,2020,2020-08-30,2020-11,30,11,,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Buildings and other structures may collapse during disaster incidents causing injuries and deaths to victims trapped under debris and rubble. Immediately after a natural disaster incident, it becomes extremely difficult for first responders and rescuers to find and save trapped victims. Often searches are carried out blindly in random locations, which delay the rescue of the victims. This paper introduces a Smartphone Assisted Disaster Recovery (SmartDR) method for post-disaster communication using Smartphones. SmartDR utilizes the device-to-device (D2D) communication technology in Fifth Generation (5G) networks, which enables direct communication between proximate devices without the need of relaying through a network infrastructure, such as mobile access points or mobile base stations. We examine a scenario of multi-hop D2D communication where smartphones carried by trapped victims and other people in disaster affected areas can self-detect the occurrence of a disaster incident by monitoring the radio environment and then can self-switch to a disaster mode to transmit emergency help messages with their location coordinates to other nearby smartphones. To locate other nearby smartphones also operating in the disaster mode and in the same channel, each smartphone runs a rendezvous process. The emergency messages are thus relayed to the functional base station or rescue centre. To facilitate routing of the emergency messages, we propose a path selection algorithm, which considers both delay and the leftover energy of a device (a smartphone in this case). Thus, the SmartDR method includes: (i) a multi-channel channel hopping rendezvous protocol to improve the victim localization or neighbour discovery, and (ii) an energy-aware multi-path routing (Energy-aware ad-hoc on-demand distance vector or E-AODV) protocol to overcome the higher energy depletion rate at devices associated with single shortest path routing. The SmartDR method can guide search and rescue operations and increase the possibility of saving lives immediately aftermath a disaster incident. A simulation-based performance study is conducted to evaluate the protocol performance in post-disaster scenario. Simulation results show that a significant performance gain is achievable when a device utilizes the channel information for the rendezvous process and the leftover energy for routing path selection. Our results show that peer discovery in multi-channel D2D environment can be significantly improved when channel quality information is considered in CH sequence design. Moreover, selecting a routing path based on LoE of a device and the standard deviation of residual energy of a path, can not only enhance the network lifetime, but also reduce the chance of network being partitioned."",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,,,,2020-12,2020,,2020-12,171,,102813,Closed,Article,""Hossain, Akbar";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Studies have demonstrated that the efficiency of global renewable energy generation (REG) is improving [4].

In all types of digital communication, error control coding techniques are used. Many digital communication standards, such as Wi-Fi and 5G, use low density parity check (LDPC) codes. These codes are popular because they provide building encoders and decoders with low computational complexity. This work objective is to increase the error correcting capability of the well-known bit-flipping decoder (BF) of LDPC-codes. For this purpose, a modification of the decoder is built, which enables to dynamically control one of its main parameters whose choice affects significantly the quality of decoding.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Materials and Methods. The well-known bit-flipping decoder of binary LDPC-codes is considered. This decoder has several parameters that are not rigidly bound with the code parameters. The dependence of the decoding quality on the selection of the output parameters of the bit-flipping decoder was investigated through simulation modeling. It is shown that the decoding results in this case are significantly affected by the input parameter of the decoder — threshold T. A modification of the BF-decoder of binary LDPC-codes has been developed, in which it is proposed to set the threshold dynamically during the execution of the algorithm depending on the error rate. A comparative analysis of the error- correcting capability of decoders is carried out by the simulation modeling method.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Results. A lemma on the maximum value of the decoder threshold T is formulated and proved. Upper bounds for the number of operations are found for the original and modified decoders. A simulation model that implements a digital noise-immune communication channel has been built. In the model, the initial data is encoded with a given LDPC-code, then it is made noisy by additive uniformly distributed errors, and thereafter, it is decoded in turn by the bit-flipping algorithm with different threshold T parameters, as well as by a modified decoder. Based on the input and output data, the correction capacity of the decoders used is estimated. Experiments have shown that the error-correcting capability of the modified decoder in the range of the real error rate is higher than that of the original decoder, regardless of the selection of its parameters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"Discussion and Conclusions. The lemma, proved in the paper, sets the upper bound on the threshold value in the original decoder, which simplifies its adjustment. The developed modification of the decoder has a better error- correcting capability compared to the original decoder. Nevertheless, the complexity of the modification is slightly increased compared to the original algorithm. It has been pointed out that the decoding quality of a modified decoder develops with a decrease in the number of cycles in the Tanner graph and an increase in the length of the code."",,,Advanced Engineering Research (Rostov-on-Don),,,,2021-04-04,2021,2021-04-04,,21,1,96-104,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In further promotion of CMfg, how to build CMfg services in an automatic and efficient manner is an essential and challenging subject. Currently, there is no literature addressing such issue. Aimed at facilitating rapid construction of CMfg services, this letter proposes a novel automated construction scheme for developing CMfg services, called Manufacturing Service Automated Construction Scheme (MSACS). First, we develop a three-phase workflow of MSACS to address the issues of how to construct CMfg services automatically using standalone software library package (SSLP). Next, we design a system architecture of MSACS to delineate how to implement MSACS. Then, we depict the designs of MSACS's core components. Finally, we apply MSACS to conduct industrial case studies to build the automatic virtual metrology cloud service and intelligent yield management cloud service for an intelligent manufacturing platform. Testing results demonstrate that MSACS can automatically construct the target CMfg services in a very efficient manner after uploading the required SSLPs.

In recent years, cloud manufacturing, encapsulating distributed manufacturing resources into cloud services for supporting all tasks in a product life cycle, has emerged as a promising concept and approach for the machining industry to achieve such a goal and gain profits. However, there has been no systematic approach to the development of cloud manufacturing systems (CMSs) for the machining industry so far. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud manufacturing framework (CMF) with auto-scaling capability (called CMFAS) aimed at providing a systematic and rapid development approach for building CMSs. The proposed CMFAS contains a cloud-based architecture which can transform single-user manufacturing functions (MFs) into cloud services that can be accessed by many users simultaneously. Also, a user-acceptable time-based scaling algorithm is designed so that the CMFAS can automatically perform scale-out or scale-in on the number of virtual machines (VMs) according to the user arrival rate, while confining the average service time for a user to be less than a specified user-acceptable time using a minimum number of VMs. Finally, we develop an Ontology Inference Cloud Service (OICS) for machine tools based on the CMFAS and deploy it on a public cloud platform for conducting integrated tests. Testing results show that the OICS can successfully recommend proper machine tools and cutting tools for machining tasks, and the proposed scaling algorithm outperforms traditional CPU-load-based scaling algorithms in terms of a smaller average service time for a user (i.e. quicker processing time) and a smaller number of created VMs (i.e. less cost of leasing cloud resources). The proposed CMFAS, together with its detailed designs, can serve as a useful reference approach for systematically and rapidly building CMSs for the machining industry."",,""This work was supported in part by Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, [grant number MOST 103-2221-E-006-155], [grant number NSC 102-2218-E-006-009-MY2], [grant number NSC 101-2218-E-006-022], [grant number NSC 102-2221-E-006-249], [grant number NSC 101-2221-E-034-023], [grant number MOST 103-2221-E-034-012], [grand number MOST 104-3011-E-006-001], [grand number MOST 104-2221-E-034-003].

Quality of service (QoS)-aware service composition is critical to the on-demand use of distributed manufacturing resources and capabilities in CMfg systems. However, most previous work plainly composed composite services by the approach of one-to-one mapping-based service composition (OOM-SC), which leads to drawbacks to both the overall QoS of composite services and the success rate of service composition. To circumvent this, an approach of synergistic elementary service group-based service composition (SESG-SC) is proposed in this paper. It releases the assumption of one-to-one mapping between elementary services and subtasks, allowing a free combination of multiple functionally equivalent elementary services into a synergistic elementary service group (SESG) to perform each subtask collectively, thereby bettering the overall QoS and achieving more acceptable success rate. To introduce an optimal construction of SESGs into the optimization model of QoS-aware service composition, three kinds of redundant structures within SESGs are discussed and the corresponding QoS evaluation formulas are also proposed. To deal with the increasing computing complexity of the optimization model, an algorithm named matrix-coded genetic algorithm with collaboratively evolutional populations (MCGA-CEP) is designed in the current study. The experimental results indicate that the proposed SESG-SC approach significantly outperforms the previous approaches, and the proposed MCGA-CEP is sound on performance-wise."",,,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,,,,2016-06-08,2016,2016-06-08,2017-02,88,9-12,2757-2771,Closed,Article,""Liu, Bo";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Resource service selection (RSS) is one of the critical techniques for implementing CMfg, which is applied for building flexible and loosely coupled service application to requestors. With lots of resource services owning similar functionality in RSS, quality of service (QoS) which can reflect user experience of service is often considered as a key technology to distinguish resource services for RSS. However, because of the heterogeneous QoS values, vast amounts of homogeneous resources and dynamic customer requirements in CMfg, the issue of how to measure fuzzy QoS and select the best services considering design preference, are rarely studied in CMfg. In this paper, we propose an integrated resource service selection approach to assist requesters to obtain optimal manufacturing services. Firstly, the problem description on resource service selection in CMfg is summarized. Then, a design preference-based QoS description model of CMfg is proposed and a QoS computation model based on fuzzy theory is presented for QoS measurement. Based on the above model, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to select the optimal service composition.

Instead, there is a need for a considerable revision of the mobile network system: such an effort is commonly referred to as the future fifth‐generation (5G) architecture , and large‐scale initiatives all around the globe have been launched worldwide to address this challenge. While these initiatives have not yet defined the future 5G architecture, the research community has already invested a very substantial effort on the definition of new individual technologies. The fact that all new proposals are tagged as 5G has created a lot of confusion on what 5G really is.

The control plane relies on the Software‐defined networking/Network Functions Virtualization concept to control and orchestrate the different elements of the network (the 5G‐Crosshaul control infrastructure). The data plane is based on an mixed optical/packet‐based forwarding entity (the 5G‐Crosshaul forwarding element) that leverages the benefits of optical passthrough with the statistical multiplexing of packet‐based transmission, working on top of a common frame format for both, fronthaul, and backhaul traffic (the 5G‐Crosshaul common frame). In addition to the main architecture design, this work includes the impact of providing multi‐tenancy support into the architecture of the overall system, in order to share the costs of building and operating the infrastructure among different operators. This architecture opens the 5G transport network as a service for innovative network applications on top (such as multi‐tenancy, and resource management), provisioning the required network and IT resources in a flexible, cost‐effective, and abstract manner. The proposed design supports the concept of network slicing pushed by the industry for realizing a truly flexible, sharable, and cost‐effective future 5G system.

However, each of these integrated communication media is not primarily meant for the specific purpose of data communication, as PLC and VLC have historically served to transfer electrical energy transfer and light, respectively. With the advent of high flickering rate light emitting diodes and efficient multiplexing/modulation schemes, both technologies are observed as potential data communication carriers. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach for modifying the modulation technique in accordance with the channel requirements of a hybrid PLC-VLC-based 5G communication systems. We provide a thorough analysis of the research work done to co-use these two technologies for data communication, suggest some exciting applications of integrated PLC-VLC systems and propose discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to tune the physical parameters as per the hybrid channel characteristics.

However, a pressing issue is the presence of incumbent systems in these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). In this paper, we first identify the key properties of incumbents by parsing databases of existing stations in major cities to devise several modeling guidelines and characterize their deployment geometry and antenna specifications. Second, we develop a detailed uplink interference framework to compute the aggregate interference from outdoor 5G-NR users into FSs. We then present several case studies in densely populated areas, using actual incumbent databases and building layouts. Our simulation results demonstrate promising 5G coexistence at 70 and 80 GHz as the majority of FSs experience interference well below the noise floor, thanks to the propagation losses in these bands and the deployment geometry of the incumbent and 5G systems. For the few FSs that may incur higher interference, we propose several passive interference mitigation techniques such as angular-based exclusion zones and spatial power control.

More technically, this concern is related to the classical data integration problem, i.e. how to universally map information from heterogeneous data sources. Adoption of CM may become possible if collaborative agents can automatically discover a set of suitable CM services, and invoke them in a particular order to achieve a certain manufacturing task. Cloud computing community suggested semantic web services in order to enable automatic discovery, invocation and orchestration of web services. In this paper, we describe a novel multi-agent framework, where agents are configured based on Belief, Desire, and Intention (BDI) formalism. In this proposed framework, agents are capable of autonomously discovering and orchestrating manufacturing services based on their intrinsic and extrinsic awareness of the manufacturing knowledge at its most contemporary state. The internal structure of agents are constructed by Horn-DL rules, arguing such DL-safe rules will be able to extract and analyze manufacturing knowledge bases, built with OWL-DL.

The users’ habit to consume online contents indoor makes the outdoor-to-indoor capacity provisioning impractical, especially when the high-frequency bands proposed for 5G are employed. The centralized radio architecture (CRA) is an in-building solution, which relies on the centralization of baseband processing functions, fully or partly allowing for centralized cell management while providing signals directly inside the buildings. On the other hand, the massive deployment of CRAs in urban areas may yield to unacceptably high installation costs, due to the radio network equipment to be activated. To make CRAs appealing to mobile operators, we propose different deployment strategies to minimize the CRA deployment cost. We define the remote radio unit placement (RRUP) problem and formulate it as an integer linear program, obtaining optimal deployment solutions in small urban residential scenarios. We prove the RRUP problem to be NP-hard, requiring heuristic approaches to solve large problem instances. To this end, we propose an effective and scalable heuristic for minimizing the amount of radio equipment required to deploy CRAs in large urban areas."",This work was supported in part by VINNOVA through the Smart City Concepts in Curitiba: Innovation for Mobility and Energy Efficiency Project and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT Digital) through The Royal Gardens Case Project.,,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,2017-06-01,2017,2017-06-01,2017-08-01,35,8,1837-1848,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In order to speed up the wide-spread deployment of such ultra-dense networks, new business and spectrum authorization models are needed. The recently proposed concept of micro operators with local spectrum micro licensing has gained significant interest in research, industry and regulation to complement the traditional models based on networks deployed and operated by the mobile network operators. While assessing the applicability of the proposed micro operator concept, one important aspect is to evaluate the impact of the inter-operator interference on the performance of the victim network when deployed in the same or adjacent channel. To support such interference evaluations between micro operators, this paper proposes a deployment scenario including two neighbouring buildings, propagation models for connections both within a building and between the buildings, and a criteria for the required minimum separation distance based on the observed throughput loss. Finally, system simulations are performed to evaluate the impact of the key deployment aspects on the required minimum separation distance between the micro operators in the 3.5 GHz band. The obtained results indicate that the required minimum separation distances are highly scenario-specific, which needs to be considered in the overall local spectrum micro licensing model development and the setup of appropriate rules to coordinate the interference."",Authors would like to acknowledge Business Finland for funding the “Micro-operator concept for boosting local service delivery in 5G (uO5G)” project.,,Wireless Personal Communications,,,,2018-03-16,2018,2018-03-16,2018-05,100,1,127-144,Closed,Article,""Hiltunen, Kimmo";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Similar to earlier terrestrial wireless technologies, build-out of 5G systems will occur initially in higher population density areas offering the best business cases while not fully addressing airborne and marine applications. Satellite communications will thus continue to be indispensable as part of an integrated 5G/satellite architecture to achieve truly universal coverage. Such a unified architecture across terrestrial and satellite wireless technologies can ensure global service, support innovative 5G use cases, and reduce both capital investments and operational costs through efficiencies in network infrastructure deployment and spectrum utilization. This article presents an architectural framework based on a layered approach comprising network, data link, and physical layers together with a multimode user terminal. The network layer uses off-the-shelf building blocks based on 4G and 5G industry standards. The data link layer benefits from dynamic sharing of resources across multiple systems, enabled by intersystem knowledge of estimated and actual traffic demands, RF situational awareness, and resource availability. Communication resource sharing has traditionally comprised time, frequency, and power dimensions. Sharing can be enhanced by leveraging dynamic knowledge of communication platform location, trajectory, and antenna directivity. Logically centralized resource management provides a scalable approach for better utilization of spectrum, especially in higher bands that have traditionally been used by satellites and now are also being proposed for 5G systems. Resource sharing maximizes the utility of a multimode terminal that can access satellite or terrestrial RF links based on specific use cases, traffic demand, and QoS requirements."",,,IEEE Network,,,,2018-01-01,2018,,2018-01-01,32,5,16-24,Closed,Article,""Gopa, Rajeev";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Different frequency bands with various signal bandwidths will be overlaid on each other in forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) radio access networks. At the same time, services, applications or features of sets of user equipment (UEs) will become more diversified and the requirements for the quality of communications will become more varied. Moreover, in real environments, roads and buildings have irregular constructions. Especially in an urban or metropolitan environment, the complex architecture present in a metropolis directly affects radio propagation. Under these conditions, the communications quality is degraded because cell radio resources are depleted due to many UE connections and the mismatch between service requirements and cell capabilities. The proposed scheme prevents this degradation in communications quality. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated in an ideal regular deployment and in a non-regular metropolitan environment based on computer simulations. Simulation results show that the average of the time for the proposed scheme from the start of transmission to the completion of reception at the UE is improved by approximately 40% compared to an existing cell selection scheme that is based on the Maximum Signal-to-Interference plus Noise power Ratio (SINR)."",,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,2017-08-01,2017,2017-08-01,2017,E100.B,8,1352-1365,Closed,Article,""KISHIDA, Akira";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Building on the premises of ultra-dense networks as well as on the adoption of multicarrier waveforms and antenna arrays in the access nodes (ANs), we first formulate extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solutions for computationally efficient joint estimation and tracking of the time of arrival (ToA) and direction of arrival (DoA) of the user nodes (UNs) using uplink reference signals. Then, a second EKF stage is proposed in order to fuse the individual DoA and ToA estimates from one or several ANs into a UN position estimate. Since all the processing takes place at the network side, the computing complexity and energy consumption at the UN side are kept to a minimum. The cascaded EKFs proposed in this article also take into account the unavoidable relative clock offsets between UNs and ANs, such that reliable clock synchronization of the access-link is obtained as a valuable by-product. The proposed cascaded EKF scheme is then revised and extended to more general and challenging scenarios where not only the UNs have clock offsets against the network time, but also the ANs themselves are not mutually synchronized in time. Finally, comprehensive performance evaluations of the proposed solutions on a realistic 5G network setup, building on the METIS project based outdoor Madrid map model together with complete ray tracing based propagation modeling, are provided.

So, in this paper an MRC SC-FDMA scheme based on measurement at 30 GHz is proposed for 5G system. Measurements were taken between three buildings under a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario for a path length of 183m. The measured impulse response was used to evaluate the PAPR, the BER and the channel capacity. A MRC combiner is used to maximize the instantaneous SNR at the output of SIMO schemes. Simulation results show a PAPR gain of 3.3 dB for the MRC-ISC-FDMA over MRC OFDMA system. The MRC SIMO (1x3) provides a BER gain of 5.2 and 4.4 dB over the traditional ISC-FDMA and LSC-FDMA respectively. Moreover, channel capacity simulations corroborate the significant increases of capacity with the increasing of the number of antennas at the receiver (achievable date rate of 6.48 Gbps at SNR = 15 dB in SIMO 1 × 3 configuration).

In particular, as the types and functions of mobile phones and IoT devices using 5G services are diversified, mutual authentication technology among multiple users is required.Methods/Statistical analysis: In this paper, we propose a multi - user authentication scheme which can efficiently mutually authenticate different types of mobile phones and IoT devices that are provided with 5G service. The proposed method minimizes the authentication delay time because it identifies the authentication security parameter δ of multiple users requesting authentication to the server as a polynomial coefficient. As a result of the performance evaluation, the proposed method showed an average improvement of 9.3% in authentication processing time and 5.5% lower overhead than the existing method. In addition, the multiuser authentication latency was improved by 6.1% on average compared with the existing scheme.Findings: The proposed scheme minimizes the user 's authentication delay time by constructing the users who simultaneously request the 5G service into a subnet and then applying the authentication security parameter δ constituting each subnet to n - bit and applying it to the polynomial coefficients. Especially, for multi - user authentication, the proposed scheme divides the authentication path into two paths (main path and secondary path) to guarantee user authentication and integrity. The proposed scheme is suitable for mobile phones and IoT devices that use low power because it generates keys without performing additional cryptographic algorithms like conventional techniques when performing multi - user authentication.Improvements/Applications: In future research, we plan to apply the proposed method to the actual environment based on the results of this study."",,,International Journal of Engineering & Technology,,,,2018-04-03,2018,2018-04-03,,7,2.12,11,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the ODN sharing scheme, the expense of building new fibers for the next-generation fifth-generation (5G) mobile backhaul networks can be reduced. As many wavelengths are allocated to the already deployed PON systems, there remain limited wavelengths for the mobile backhaul systems. Hence, to efficiently increase the serving cell sites of the 5G systems, spectral-efficient orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted in the mobile backhaul systems. In order to reduce the latency of the system, adaptive adjustment of the OFDM signals for different transmission distances is averted. The OFDM signals are transmitted only using specific available bandwidth. The available bandwidth for each wavelength is studied according to the power fading relationship between the transmission distances and the chirp induced from signal modulation. A proof-of-concept demonstration experiment has been performed. In our results, 20.17 Gb/s with a bit error rate (BER) lower than 3.8 × 10-3 was realized with a split ratio of 256 and a 40-km transmission distance of the PON ODN.

However, massive access nodes increase the risk of cell outages, leading to negative impact on user‐perceived QoS (Quality of Service) and QoE (Quality of Experience). Thus, cell outage management (COM) became a key function proposed in SON (Self‐Organized Networks) use cases. Based on COM, cell outage detection (COD) will be resolved before cell outage compensation (COC). Currently few studies concentrate on COD for 5G H‐CRAN, and we propose self‐organized COD architecture and approach for it. We firstly summarize current COD solutions for LTE/LTE‐A HetNets and then introduce self‐organized architecture and approach suitable for H‐CRAN, which includes COD architecture and procedures, and corresponding key technologies for it.

Due to the nature of mobile traffic distribution in practice which is both time-variant and spatially non-uniform, dynamic construction of mmWave meshed backhaul is a prerequisite to support the varying traffic distribution. Focusing on such scenario of outdoor dynamic crowd (ODC), this paper proposes a novel method to control mmWave meshed backhaul for efficient operation of mmWave overlay 5G HetNet through Software-Defined Network (SDN) technology. Our algorithm is featured by two functionalities, i.e., backhauling route multiplexing for overloaded mmWave small cell base stations (SC-BSs) and mmWave SC-BSs’ ON/OFF status switching for underloaded spot. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed meshed network is confirmed by both numerical analyses and experimental results. Simulations are conducted over a practical user distribution modeled from measured data in realistic environments. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can cope with the locally intensive traffic and reduce energy consumption. Furthermore, a WiGig (Wireless Gigabit Alliance certified) device based testbed is developed for Proof-of-Concept (PoC) and preliminary measurement results confirm the proposed dynamic formation of the meshed network’s efficiency."",The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the paper.,""This research was funded by the European Commission (EC) H2020 and the Ministry of Internal affairs and Communications (MIC) in Japan under grant agreements No 723171 5G-MiEdge in EC and {0159-0077, 0155-0074} in MIC.

Full duplex allows a node to transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band, thus, theoretically, doubling the system throughput over conventional half-duplex systems. A key limitation in building a feasible full-duplex node is the self-interference, i.e., the interference generated by the transmitted signal to the desired signal received on the same node. This constraint has been overcome given the recent advances in the self-interference cancellation technology. However, there are other limitations in achieving the theoretical full-duplex gain: residual self-interference, traffic constraints, and inter-cell and intra-cell interference. The contribution of this article is twofold. Firstly, achievable levels of self-interference cancellation are demonstrated using our own developed test bed. Secondly, a detailed evaluation of full-duplex communication in 5G ultra-dense small cell networks via system level simulations is provided. The results are presented in terms of throughput and delay. Two types of full duplex are studied: when both the station and the user equipments are full duplex capable and when only the base station is able to exploit simultaneous transmission and reception. The impact of the traffic profile and the inter-cell and intra-cell interferences is addressed, individually and jointly. Results show that the increased interference that simultaneous transmission and reception causes is one of the main limiting factors in achieving the promised full-duplex throughput gain, while large traffic asymmetries between downlink and uplink further compromise such gain."",,,EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,,,,2016-12-13,2016,2016-12-13,2016-12,2016,1,284,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

But engineers have been so preoccupied with designing and building the low-latency networks for these emerging applications that they've neglected the rest of our vast, tangled telecom networks. The result is that there's now a growing gap between the capabilities of the fixed and mobile sides of these networks. • Think of the mobile side as the antennas and radio waves that deliver data to our devices. This is the side that has gotten a lot of attention in recent years with the advent of beamforming and millimeter waves. The fixed side is everything else—the cables, fibers, and switches that handle our long-distance communications. The United Nations' International Telecommunication Union (ITU), an agency that coordinates telecom infrastructure between countries, launched a focus group in August to address this emerging imbalance in wireless communications. • """"Right now, when people start deploying [5G], it's the mobile side,"""" says Richard Li, the chief scientist of future networks at Huawei and the chairman of the ITU Network 2030 focus group. """"But the fixed network side is still 4G. They do not match."""" The upshot is that while the larger amounts of data heralded by 5G will zip through edge infrastructure without delay, once that same data reaches the less-advanced core infrastructure it could very well be throttled. • A big part of the problem is that the way data moves through our networks has been designed for efficiency on the mobile side.

A new radio interface with time division duplexing (TDD) and radio access based on orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is implemented in a 5G testbed to confirm ultra-high speed transmission with low latency. The indoor experiment in an entrance hall shows that the peak throughput is 4.3Gbps in front of the base station (BS) antenna where the reference signal received power (RSRP) is -40dBm although the channel correlation at user equipment (UE) antenna is 0.8. The outdoor experiment in an open-space parking area shows that the peak throughput is 2.8Gbps in front of a BS antenna with a high RSRP although rank 2 is selected due to the high channel correlation. The results also show that the average throughput of 2Gbps is achieved 120m from the BS antenna. In a courtyard enclosed by building walls, 3.6Gbps is achieved in an outdoor-to-outdoor environment with a high RSRP and in an outdoor-to-indoor environment where the RSRP is lower due to the penetration loss of glass windows, but the multipath rich environment contributes to realizing the low channel correlation."",,,IEICE Transactions on Communications,,,,2017-08-01,2017,2017-08-01,2017,E100.B,8,1238-1246,Closed,Article,""TATEISHI, Kiichi";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To address it, 3GPP is currently working on multi-connectivity mechanisms that allow a user to remain connected to several mmWave access points simultaneously, as well as switch between them in case its active connection drops. However, the actual number of such simultaneous linksnamed the degree of multi-connectivityto reach the desired tradeoff between the system design simplicity and the outage probability levels remains an open research question. In this work, we characterize the outage probability and spectral efficiency associated with different degrees of multi-connectivity in a typical 5G urban scenario, where the line-of-sight propagation path can be blocked by buildings as well as humans. These results demonstrate that the degrees of multi-connectivity of up to 4 offer higher relative gains.

This trend is especially notable for the manufacturing industry where Big Data applications, i.e. data analytics, are mentioned as an important enabler of value creation with the event of the fourth industrial revolution. Designing and building the entire data value chain that enables Big Data applications in manufacturing requires new knowledge about digital technologies combined with already established knowledge about the specific manufacturing processes. This paper focuses on the convergence of these different knowledge spaces applied to a specific case of implementing a Big Data application for predictive maintenance. Every step of building the data value chain from data acquisition to system feedback is presented and discussed in terms of the major challenges that were observed during the project.

Deployment scenarios envision a multi-layer use of macro, micro and femto-cells where multi-mode end devices, supporting different applications, are served by different technologies. The association of end devices to the most appropriate RAT/layer will therefore become a tantalizing process necessitating the introduction of mechanisms that decide and execute an optimal mapping. The latter is of paramount importance since sub-optimal configuration of network components will affect overall network performance. Towards this end, we introduce the Context Extraction and Profiling Engine (CEPE), a knowledge discovery (KDD) framework catering for the extraction and exploitation of user behavioral patterns from network and service information. An eNB exploits the knowledge scheme derived by CEPE in order to improve the placement of end devices to RATs/layers. In the context of this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of existing standards, research papers and patents, discuss the main innovation of our proposal and highlight the differences with existing schemes. Building on use cases involving mobility management mechanisms that typically affect device to technology mapping (i.e. cell (re)selection, handover) we provide an extensive set of experiments that demonstrate the validity and viability of our idea.

During the assessment from techno-economic perspective, in addition to the level of the user demand, we also take into account the wall penetration losses, density of existing/new base station sites and the recent improvements in cost of the hierarchical cell structures. We consider a spectral efficiency relevant for the forthcoming advanced radio access technologies like: 4G LTE-Advanced or LTE-A (Long Term Evolution Release 10 and beyond), 5G cellular systems deployed in the millimeter-wave (mmW) bands and high-capacity wireless local area network (WLAN) standards like IEEE 802.11ac/ad. In order to compare the achievable profit margins of various network architectures, through extensive network dimensioning for the dense-urban environment and considering the total network cost in present value, we determine the cost-efficient capacity expansion strategies for the mobile network operators by means of proper relation of the production cost per transferred data to the revenues.

However, the stringent requirements of current fronthaul solutions hinder its large-scale deployment. In order to introduce C-RAN widely in 5G, the next generation fronthaul interface (NGFI) will be based on a cost-efficient packet-based network with higher path diversity. In addition, NGFI shall support a flexible functional split of the RAN to adapt the amount of centralization to the capabilities of the transport network. In this paper we question the ability of standard techniques to route NGFI traffic while maximizing the centralization degree—the goal of C-RAN. We propose two solutions jointly addressing both challenges: ($i$ ) a nearly-optimal backtracking scheme, and ($ii$ ) a low-complex greedy approach. We first validate the feasibility of our approach in an experimental proof-of-concept, and then evaluate both algorithms via simulations in large-scale (real and synthetic) topologies.

OFDM requires that the received subcarriers be orthogonal. However, various factors, such as residual carrier frequency offset due to Doppler shift in mobile fading channels, can lead to a loss in orthogonality between subcarriers, which results in intersymbol interference (ISI), intercarrier interference (ICI), and bit error rate (BER) degradation. In developing the conjugate cancelation (CC) scheme for mitigating these ISI and ICI of OFDM systems, we integrate the CC scheme together with a space–time (ST) system and form an STCC multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) scheme. This STCC system improves the BER without expending power or bandwidth or complexity. Additionally, a Walsh–Hadamard (WH) transform is employed as a precoder for this STCC system and forms a novel WHSTCC scheme. It provides a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) at the transmitter and a significant diversity gain at the receiver. Simulations indicate that both STCC and WHSTCC schemes outperform the regular CC and ST systems in mobile fading channels.

An appropriate channel model for typical scenarios in a built-up environment is crucially needed for development of future technologies such as 5G. This paper presents an efficient millimeter wave wideband propagation model that can be used for analysis and design purposes. Unlike the commonly used two-ray and statistical models, the proposed model has higher reliability and accuracy to simulate the considered environment. The uniform theory of diffraction has been used to calculate the total received signal due to multi-reflection–diffraction for both linear and circular polarization. Mathematical formulas have been derived for each considered ray contribution in terms of the building dimensions and the distances between the building, mobile and transmitter.

Knife-edge diffraction (KED) and a creeping wave linear model are shown to predict diffraction loss around typical building objects from 10 to 26 GHz, and human blockage measurements at 73 GHz are shown to fit a double KED model, which incorporates antenna gains. Small-scale spatial fading of millimeter wave (mmWave)-received signal voltage amplitude is generally Ricean-distributed for both omnidirectional and directional receive antenna patterns under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions in most cases, although the log-normal distribution fits measured data better for the omnidirectional receive antenna pattern in the NLOS environment. Small-scale spatial autocorrelations of received voltage amplitudes are shown to fit sinusoidal exponential and exponential functions for LOS and NLOS environments, respectively, with small decorrelation distances of 0.27–13.6 cm (smaller than the size of a handset) that are favorable for spatial multiplexing. Local area measurements using cluster and route scenarios show how the received signal changes as the mobile moves and transitions from LOS to NLOS locations, with reasonably stationary signal levels within clusters. Wideband mmWave power levels are shown to fade from 0.4 dB/ms to 40 dB/s, depending on travel speed and surroundings."",,,IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation,,,,2017-11-28,2017,2017-11-28,,65,12,6474-6490,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While D2D connectivity originally emerged as a technology enabler for public safety services, it is likely to remain at the heart of the 5G ecosystem by spawning a wide diversity of proximate applications and services. In this work, we argue that the widespread adoption of the direct communications paradigm is unlikely without embracing the concepts of trust and social-aware cooperation between end users and network operators. However, such adoption remains conditional on identifying adequate incentives that engage humans and their connected devices in a plethora of collective activities. To this end, the mission of our research is to advance the vision of social-aware and trusted D2D connectivity, as well as to facilitate its further adoption. We begin by reviewing the various types of underlying incentives with the emphasis on sociality and trust, discuss these factors specifically for humans and for networked devices (machines), and also propose a novel framework allowing construction of much needed incentive-aware D2D applications. Our supportive system-level performance evaluations suggest that trusted and social-aware direct connectivity has the potential to decisively augment network performance.

As vehicles in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are mainly used for safety related applications, so there is a need of an efficient QoS-aware data dissemination for various applications in different regions especially in dense urban regions where congestion is one of the major issues. Hence, to address this issue, in this paper, we propose a new mechanism to maintain QoS for data dissemination among the different vehicles in VANETs. An intelligent forwarding mechanism is used by newly defined metric which assigns weights to the different routing paths from source to destination. Separate algorithms are designed for route construction, and maintenance in the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is studied by extensive simulations with respect to various metrics such as delay incurred, percentage of active links, and load on the network.

In this paper, the statistics of large-scale path loss and time dispersion parameters are investigated based on ultra-wideband measurements using a steerable directional horn antenna at transmitter (Tx) and omni-directional antenna at the receiver (Rx). The measurement was conducted in a dining room line-of-sight (LOS) scenario, which represents a typical closed-plan for in-building communication. The single-frequency, multi-frequency directional and omni-directional large-scale path loss models are evaluated at 28 GHz and 38 GHz bands based on data acquired from unique Tx and Rx antennas with combination pointing angles. The results show that the large-scale path loss models for indoor propagation developed in this paper is less complex, and yet more physically-based than those used in the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) systems, which involve additional model parameters but yield less accurate results. The time dispersion statistics for mmWave systems using directional antennas and omni-omni antennas configuration at both Tx and Rx are presented for co-polarization scenarios.

This will necessitate operation over a versatile set of wireless channels ranging from indoor to outdoor, from line-of-sight (LOS) to non-LOS, and from circularly symmetric scattering to environments which promote the clustering of scattered multipath waves. Unfortunately, many of the conventional fading models lack the flexibility to account for such disparate signal propagation mechanisms. To bridge the gap between theory and practical channels, we consider κ-μ shadowed fading, which contains as special cases the majority of the linear fading models proposed in the open literature. In particular, we propose an analytic framework to evaluate the average of an arbitrary function of the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) over κ-μ shadowed fading channels by using an orthogonal expansion with tools from stochastic geometry. Using the proposed method, we evaluate the spectral efficiency, moments of the SINR, and outage probability of a K-tier heterogeneous cellular network with K classes of base stations (BSs), differing in terms of the transmit power, BS density, shadowing, and fading characteristics.

"                  In this paper, a multi-band enabled femtocell base station (FCBS) and user equipment (UE) architecture is proposed in a multi-tier network that consists of small cells, including femtocells and picocells deployed over the coverage of a macrocell for splitting uplink and downlink (UL/DL) as well as control-plane and user-plane (C-/U-plane) for 5G mobile networks. Since splitting is performed at the same FCBS, we define this architecture as the same base station based split architecture (SBSA). For multiple bands, we consider co-channel (CC) microwave and different frequency (DF) 60 GHz millimeter wave (mmWave) bands for FCBSs and UEs with respect to the microwave band used by their over-laid macrocell base station. All femtocells are assumed to be deployed in a 3-dimensional multi-storage building. For CC microwave band, cross-tier CC interference of femtocells with macrocell is avoided using almost blank subframe based enhanced inter-cell interference coordination techniques. The co-existence of CC microwave and DF mmWave bands for SBSA on the same FCBS and UE is first studied to show their performance disparities in terms of system capacity and spectral efficiency in order to provide incentives for employing multiple bands at the same FCBS and UE and identify a suitable band for routing decoupled UL/DL or C-/U-plane traffic. We then present a number of disruptive architectural design alternatives of multi-band enabled SBSA for 5G mobile networks for UL/DL and C-/U-plane splitting, including a disruptive and complete splitting of UL/DL and C-/U-plane as well as a combined UL/DL and C-/U-plane splitting, by exploiting dual connectivity on CC microwave and DF mmWave bands. The outperformances of SBSA in terms of system level capacity, average spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and control-plane overhead traffic capacity in comparison with different base stations based split architecture (DBSA) are shown.

Due to the strong path loss in free space at the millimeter-wave frequency range, high gain and low-cost antennas are in great demand. Also, advanced features such as multi-beam for multiple user, dual-polarization, or even complete phased arrays with enormous degrees of freedom in beamforming are some of the key research lines for antenna designers nowadays. In this article an overview of a new type of family of low-loss antennas and components based on the recently developed gap waveguide technology is presented.

While developments in electromagnetic solvers allows accurate conformal array analysis, this study presents a method for predicting the maximum gain pattern for conformal antenna arrays using Standard Triangular/Tessellation Language models for aperture and obstruction geometry. Using raycasting techniques, the aperture model allows the prediction of the maximum gain pattern in the presence of obstructions. The maximum gain patterns are shown for a conformal antenna array integrated into the curved corner of a building, and a conformal antenna array integrated into the wing leading edge of an aircraft. This technique presents an invaluable tool to assess the viability of a conformal aperture on a structure, while allowing for variation of the structure to assess performance implications for the conformal antenna array. This study shows the increase in maximum beam steering angle of 13° from a purely planar array for the array integrated into a building, and the aeroplane wing leading edge is shown to produce a maximum achievable gain of 41.7 dB, which is 1.7 dB higher than a conventional nose-mounted planar array could be expected to achieve with a greatly increased field of view."",,,IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters,,,,2017-03-27,2017,2017-03-27,,16,,700-703,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Initially, an SF architecture is developed to form an SF-OFDM system. Second, a conjugate cancellation two-path transmission scheme is integrated with the SF-OFDM system to form a new SFCC-OFDM system. Third, three orthogonal transforms, Haar, Walsh–Hadamard, and discrete Hartley transform, are employed as the precoder to form HAARSFCC-, WHSFCC-, and HTSFCC-OFDM systems. These precoded systems improve bit error rate without expanding power or bandwidth in comparing with the SFCC scheme. Simulations indicate that all three precoded systems outperform the SF- and SFCC-OFDM systems. All these SFCC schemes are simple and backward compatible with the existing OFDM system.

The word error rate versus the signal-to-noise ratio is found for LDPC, Reed–Muller, polar, turbo, Golay, random, and BCH codes at length 20, 32 and 256 bits. BCH and random codes outperform other codes in absence of a cyclic redundancy check concatenation. Under joint decoding, the concatenation of a cyclic redundancy check makes all codes perform very close to optimal lower bounds.

Applications of 3D City Models range from assessing the potential output of solar panels across a city to determining the best location for 5G mobile phone masts. While in the past these models were not readily available, the rapid increase of available data from sources such as Open Data (e.g. OpenStreetMap), National Mapping and Cadastral Agencies and increasingly Building Information Models facilitates the implementation of increasingly detailed 3D Models. However, these sources also generate integration challenges relating to heterogeneity, storage and efficient management and visualization. CityGML and IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) are two standards that serve different application domains (GIS and BIM) and are commonly used to store and share 3D information. The ability to convert data from IFC to CityGML in a consistent manner could generate 3D City Models able to represent an entire city, but that also include detailed geometric and semantic information regarding its elements. However, CityGML and IFC present major differences in their schemas, rendering interoperability a challenging task, particularly when details of a building’s internal structure are considered (Level of Detail 4 in CityGML). The aim of this paper is to investigate interoperability options between the aforementioned standards, by converting IFC models to CityGML LoD 4 Models. The CityGML Models are then semantically enriched and the proposed methodology is assessed in terms of model’s geometric validity and capability to preserve semantics."",,,The International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences,,,,2018-09-12,2018,2018-09-12,,XLII-4/W10,,33-40,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"                  In recent years, advancements in High Performance Computing and Photonics are driving towards high density semiconductor packaging requirements that are creating a need for the adoption of novel material sets. Glass has many attractive properties that help address product level challenges such as low height, and smaller, packages. Glass also offers high resistivity, low dielectric constant, adjustable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and low electrical loss. These properties can also be leveraged for RF and Mobile applications where battery life is paramount. To further utilize glass' material properties for interposers and compact substrates, it is necessary to form precision or Through Glass Vias (TGVs). Mobile cellular networks are rapidly evolving towards fifth generation (5G), which is set to exploit a wider spectrum of frequencies that range into millimeter wave (mmWave). RF MEMS technology is a promising approach to addressing RF Switches, which are key building blocks into Radio Frequency Front Ends (RFFE).

As an important aspect of network virtualization, network topology virtualization is studied in this workfrom traditional network embedding toward full network topology virtualization. By full virtualization, the tenant virtual network can specify whatever network topology without knowing the underlying physical network and get the same experience as building a physical network by his own. Based on the switches with a late-binding key extractor, not only one-to-one and many-to-one mapping, but also one-to-many mappings are enabled in full virtualization of network topologies. In this paper, we propose a restricted differential evolution topology virtualization algorithm to achieve efficient mapping from a virtual network to a physical network in full virtualization. Furthermore, migration approaches are carried out to tackle the mapping failure of the virtual network topology.

"462,pub.1109891599,10.3390/info9110279,,,Smart Process Optimization and Adaptive Execution with Semantic Services in Cloud Manufacturing ‡,""A new requirement for the manufacturing companies in Industry 4.0 is to be flexible with respect to changes in demands, requiring them to react rapidly and efficiently on the production capacities. Together with the trend to use Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), this requirement induces a need for agile collaboration among supply chain partners, but also between different divisions or branches of the same company. In order to address this collaboration challenge, we propose a novel pragmatic approach for the process analysis, implementation and execution. This is achieved through sets of semantic annotations of business process models encoded into BPMN 2.0 extensions. Building blocks for such manufacturing processes are the individual available services, which are also semantically annotated according to the Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) principles and stored into a common marketplace. The optimization of such manufacturing processes combines pattern-based semantic composition of services with their non-functional aspects. This is achieved by means of Quality-of-Service (QoS)-based Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) solving, resulting in an automatic implementation of service-based manufacturing processes. The produced solution is mapped back to the BPMN 2.0 standard formalism by means of the introduced extension elements, fully detailing the enactable optimal process service plan produced. This approach allows enacting a process instance, using just-in-time service leasing, allocation of resources and dynamic replanning in the case of failures. This proposition provides the best compromise between external visibility, control and flexibility. In this way, it provides an optimal approach for business process models’ implementation, with a full service-oriented taste, by implementing user-defined QoS metrics, just-in-time execution and basic dynamic repairing capabilities. This paper presents the described approach and the technical architecture and depicts one initial industrial application in the manufacturing domain of aluminum forging for bicycle hull body forming, where the advantages stemming from the main capabilities of this approach are sketched."",,,Information,,,,2018-11-13,2018,2018-11-13,,9,11,279,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we firstly propose the joint iterative detection and decoding (JIDD) receiver for the uplink polar coded sparse code multiple access (PC-SCMA) system. Then, the EXIT chart is used to investigate the performance of the JIDD receiver. Additionally, we optimize the system design and polar code construction based on the EXIT chart analysis. The proposed receiver integrates the factor graph of SCMA detector and polar soft-output decoder into a joint factor graph, which enables the exchange of messages between SCMA detector and polar decoder iteratively. Simulation results demonstrate that the JIDD receiver has better BER performance and lower complexity than the separate scheme. Specifically, when polar code length $N=256$ and code rate $R = 1/2$ , JIDD outperforms the separate scheme 4.8 and 6 dB over AWGN channel and Rayleigh fading channel, respectively. It also shows that, under 150% system loading, the JIDD receiver only has 0.3 dB performance loss compared to the single user uplink PC-SCMA over AWGN channel and 0.6 dB performance loss over Rayleigh fading channel."",""This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61501479, Grant 61372098, Grant 61702536, and Grant 61502518, and the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province under Grant 2017JJ2303 and Grant 2018JJ3609."",,IEEE Access,,,,2018-01-01,2018,2018-09-13,2018-01-01,6,,52014-52026,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) appears a promising candidate technology for building an agile communication model that reduces latency via a fully distributed and adaptive delivery approach coupling in-network caching and forwarding. In the paper, we investigate theoretically and empirically the role of latency awareness on multipath ICN delivery performance and analyze FOCAL, an approach combining novel caching and forwarding strategies to jointly reduce end-user experienced latency with no network signaling nor coordination between routers.FOCAL gathers a latency-proportional probabilistic caching policy, with a load-aware dynamic forwarding strategy, that preferentially routes popular content requests through a single path (set of caches), while globally achieving minimum network load and user content delivery time, thus delay minimization. By means of ICN simulations, we assess the advantages of FOCAL over existing alternatives given by the combinations of known caching policies and forwarding strategies. FOCAL drastically improves end-user delivery performance as it reduces by up to 60% the mean and variance of content delivery time. It also results in a faster convergence to these figures, even under the varying network conditions induced by non-stationary content popularity distributions."",,,Computer Networks,,,,2016-12,2016,,2016-12,110,,133-153,Closed,Article,""Carofiglio, Giovanna";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The overall mm-μW resource management should, therefore, harmonize with each other. This paper aims at maximizing the overall downlink (DL) rate with a minimum uplink (UL) rate constraint, and concludes: mmW tends to focus more on DL transmissions while μW has high priority for complementing UL, under time-division duplex (TDD) mmW operations. Such UL dedication of μW results from the limited use of mmW UL bandwidth due to excessive power consumption and/or high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) at mobile users. To further relieve this UL bottleneck, we propose mmW UL decoupling that allows each legacy μW base station (BS) to receive mmW signals. Its impact on mm-μW resource management is provided in a tractable way by virtue of a novel closed-form mm-μW spectral efficiency (SE) derivation. In an ultra-dense cellular network (UDN), our derivation verifies mmW (or μW) SE is a logarithmic function of BS-to-user density ratio.

Cooperative relaying is a novel technique for wireless communications that increases throughput and extends the coverage of networks. The task of relay selection serves as a building block to realize cooperative relaying. Recently, relays with buffers have been incorporated into cooperative relaying providing extra degrees of freedom in selection, thus improving various performance metrics, such as outage probability, power reduction, and throughput, at the expense of tolerating an increase in packet delay. In this survey, we review and classify various buffer-aided relay selection policies and discuss their importance through applications. The classification is mainly based on the following aspects: 1) duplexing capabilities, 2) channel state information (CSI), 3) transmission strategies, 4) relay mode, and 5) performance metrics. Relay selection policies for enhanced physical-layer security and cognitive communications with reduced interference are also discussed. Then, a framework for modeling such algorithms is presented based on Markov Chain theory. In addition, performance evaluation is conducted for various buffer-aided relay selection algorithms. To provide a broad perspective on the role of buffer-aided relay selection, various issues relevant to fifth-generation (5G) networks are discussed.

In such cloud-based mobile networks, ensuring service resilience is an important challenge to tackle. Indeed, high availability and service reliability are important requirements of carrier grade, but not necessarily intrinsic features of cloud computing. Building a system that requires the five nines reliability on a platform that may not always grant it is, therefore, a hurdle. Effectively, in carrier cloud, service resilience can be heavily impacted by a failure of any network function (NF) running on a virtual machine (VM). In this paper, we introduce a framework, along with efficient and proactive restoration mechanisms, to ensure service resilience in carrier cloud. As restoration of a NF failure impacts a potential number of users, adequate network overload control mechanisms are also proposed. A mathematical model is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanisms. The obtained results are encouraging and demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms efficiently achieve their design goals."",,,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,,,,2016-03-10,2016,2016-03-10,,34,3,483-496,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The blocker signal could either be the transceiver’s own transmit signal when operating in frequency-division duplex, or a WiFi-related signal received by the antenna. This so-called modulated spur interference contains the phase-noise (PN) of the involved local oscillator harmonics which created the spur and leads to a degradation of the wanted RX signal. The presented mixed-signal circuit mimics the spur building law including the PN of the harmonics and is, therefore, able to provide a replica of the spur interference including PN modulated components. This replica is then used as a reference signal for the digital cancellation of the main and image modulated spur interference using a widely-linear (WL) cancellation structure. The proposed circuit technique is implemented in 28 nm LP CMOS technology, and measurement results show that the mixed-signal solution outperforms a digital-only WL cancellation with respect to PN cancellation even with high blocker power levels of −15 dBm at the input of the low-noise amplifier."",""This work was supported in part by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy and the National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development.

The viability of mmWave for energy harvesting though is unclear, due to the differences in propagation characteristics, such as extreme sensitivity to building blockages. This paper considers a scenario where low-power devices extract energy and/or information from the mmWave signals. Using stochastic geometry, analytical expressions are derived for the energy coverage probability, the average harvested power, and the overall (energy-and-information) coverage probability at a typical wireless-powered device in terms of the BS density, the antenna geometry parameters, and the channel parameters. Numerical results reveal several network and device level design insights. At the BSs, optimizing the antenna geometry parameters, such as beamwidth, can maximize the network-wide energy coverage for a given user population. At the device level, the performance can be substantially improved by optimally splitting the received signal for energy and information extraction, and by deploying multi-antenna arrays. For the latter, an efficient low-power multi-antenna mmWave receiver architecture is proposed for simultaneous energy and information transfer. Overall, simulation results suggest that mmWave energy harvesting generally outperforms lower frequency solutions."",,,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,,,,2016-09-08,2016,2016-09-08,,15,9,6048-6062,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of the constantly increasing number of radio transmitters with various wireless technologies and with the advent of 5G cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT), the required size of the RSS databases are becoming unmanageably large. Thus, the requirements for the bandwidth and data rates for accessing the memory might become too costly. Therefore, in order to reduce the size of the RSS database, while maintaining the data quality, we have previously proposed the method of spectrally compressed RSS images, which are able to achieve considerable data compression of up to 70 percent. In this paper, we deeply analyze the process of spectral compression and introduce error sources, which affect the compression performance. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel theoretical framework and methods to optimize the performance of the spectral compression. In addition, we derive the Cramr-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the RSS-based localization error and compare the CRLB between separate baseline localization approaches.

First, self-adaptive analog RF cancellation circuitry is required, since the ability to track time-varying self-interference coupling characteristics is of utmost importance in mobile devices. In addition, novel adaptive nonlinear DSP methods are also required for final self-interference suppression at digital baseband, since mobile-scale devices typically operate under highly nonlinear low-cost RF components. In addition to describing the above kind of advanced circuit and signal processing solutions, comprehensive RF measurement results from a complete demonstrator implementation are also provided, evidencing beyond 40 dB of active RF cancellation over an 80 MHz waveform bandwidth with a highly nonlinear transmitter power amplifier. Measured examples also demonstrate the good self-healing characteristics of the developed control loop against fast changes in the coupling channel. Furthermore, when complemented by nonlinear digital cancellation processing, the residual self-interference level is pushed down to the noise floor of the demonstration system, despite the harsh nonlinear nature of the self-interference. These findings indicate that deploying the full-duplex principle can indeed also be feasible in mobile devices, and thus be one potential technology in, for example, 5G and beyond radio systems."",,,IEEE Communications Magazine,,,,2016-09-12,2016,2016-09-12,,54,9,80-87,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

OFDM is the basic building block for multicarrier modulation in most contemporary networks such as vehicular ad hoc networks, Internet of Things (IoT), as well as 4G/5G systems. Most existing OFDM-based security solutions lack the notion of secrecy and dynamicity when combining a secret key with random information extracted from the physical channel. Yet, some solutions perform encryption preinverse fast Fourier transform and some postinverse fast Fourier transform, without clear guidelines concerning the impact on performance and security. In this paper, OFDM-based encryption schemes at the PHY are investigated, analyzed, and weaknesses are identified. It is shown that encryption in the frequency domain slightly mitigates the effects of channel fading and improves the bit error-rate performance. On the other hand, time-domain encryption is shown to be more secure. Furthermore, a dynamic secret key approach that enhances the security level of OFDM-based encryption schemes, in addition to a new technique for updating cipher primitives for input OFDM symbols or frames, are proposed. These schemes are shown to strike a good balance between performance and security robustness as demonstrated through experimental simulations."",This work was supported in part by the University Research Board (URB) at the American University of Beirut (AUB).,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,,,2018-06-12,2018,2018-06-12,2019-02-01,6,1,361-378,Closed,Article,""Melki, Reem";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Good decoupling between two UWB antennas spaced by 3 mm only and having a small total length of 35 mm (about 0.385λ at 3300 MHz) is obtained without external decoupling structures. The isolation of two nearby UWB antennas is better than 10 dB and the envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) thereof is less than 0.1 in 3300∼6000 MHz.

Use of multipath transport is gaining momentum for supporting these applications. However, building an efficient, low latency multipath transfer mechanism remains highly challenging. The primary reason for this is that the delivery delay along each path is typically uncertain and time-varying. When the transmitter ignores the stochastic nature of the path delays, then packets sent along different paths frequently arrive out of order and need to be buffered at the receiver to allow in-order delivery to the application. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Earliest Delivery Path First (S-EDPF), a generalization of EDPF which takes into account uncertainty and time-variation in path delays yet has low-complexity suited to practical implementation. Moreover, we integrate a novel low-delay Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme into S-EDPF in a principled manner by deriving the optimal schedule for coded packets across multiple paths. Finally, we demonstrate, both analytically and empirically, that S-EDPF is effective at mitigating the delay impact of reordering and loss in multipath transport protocols, offering substantial performance gains over the state of the art."",This work has received funding from the Science Foundation Ireland under grant agreement No 11/PI/1177 and the European Union&#x27";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As such, a lot of attention has been devoted to the development of decoding algorithms with good error performance and efficient hardware implementation. One of the leading candidates in this regard is represented by successive-cancelation list (SCL) decoding. However, its hardware implementation requires a large amount of memory. Recently, a partitioned SCL (PSCL) decoder has been proposed to significantly reduce the memory consumption. In this paper, we consider the paradigm of PSCL decoding from a practical standpoint, and we provide several improvements. First, by changing the target signal-to-noise ratio and consequently modifying the construction of the code, we are able to improve the performance at no additional computational, latency, or memory cost. Second, we bridge the performance gap between SCL and PSCL decoding by introducing a generalized PSCL decoder and a layered PSCL decoder. In this way, we obtain almost the same performance of the SCL decoder with a significantly lower memory requirement, as testified by hardware implementation results. Third, we present an optimal scheme to allocate cyclic redundancy checks.

IM is a highly spectrum- and energy-efficient yet simple digital modulation technique, which utilizes the indices of the building blocks of the corresponding communication systems to convey additional information bits. IM systems provide alternative ways to transmit information in contrast to traditional digital modulation schemes that rely on the modulation of the amplitude/phase/frequency of a sinusoidal carrier signal for transmission, as widely considered in the field of communications over the past 50 years. Radically, IM schemes have the ability to map information bits by altering the on/off status of their transmission entities such as transmit antennas, subcarriers, radio frequency (RF) mirrors, transmit light emitting diodes, relays, modulation types, time slots, precoder matrices, dispersion matrices, spreading codes, signal powers, loads and so on. In other words, IM creates completely new dimensions for data transmission. Since the initial skepticism of both academia and industry on the potential and applicability of IM technologies has now gone away, we strongly believe that IM is not another simple digital modulation alternative, but rather can be a game-changing communication paradigm whose time has come!"",,,IEEE Access,,,,2018-06-04,2018,2018-06-04,,6,,26452-26456,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Laboratory test allows evaluating the acoustical performance of resilient surface layers in terms of reduction of impact sound pressure level ΔL. Resilient surface layers applied on the top of the structural reference floor effectively reduce the impact noise produced in the receiving room by a tapping machine excitation. In any case, an accurate characterization of the acoustical performances of the resilient surface layers depends on several boundary conditions. In this paper, it is shown a very relevant effect on the measurement accuracy, due to the cleaning condition of the structural reference floor. In particular it has been observed that the presence of sand and/or dust (in a very small quantity, i.e. of about 5g/m2) scattered on the bare slab greatly influences the experimental results. Researchers and technicians involved in building acoustic measurements in standard laboratories are well aware about the issues of proper cleaning, in particular if the resilient surface layers must be fixed on the surface by gluing. Nevertheless, the ISO 10140 standard (as well as previous ISO 140 standard series) does not state, as requirement, to glue the layers on the surface of the reference floor.

The target of this paper is to emphasize the gains and significance of the novel concept of SPMA in achieving better and homogeneous SIR and enhanced system capacity in a macrocellular environment. This paper also explains the algorithm of SIR computation in SPMA. The results presented in this paper are based on sophisticated 3D ray tracing simulations performed with real world 3D building data and site locations from Seoul, South Korea. Macrocellular environment dominated with indoor users was considered for the research purpose of this paper. It is found that by increasing the order of sectorization, SIR along with spectral efficiency degrades due to the increase in inter-cell interference. However, as a result of better area spectral efficiency due to increased number of sectors (cells), the higher order sectorization offers more system capacity compared to the traditional 3-sector site. Furthermore, SPMA shows an outstanding performance and significantly improves the SIR for the individual user over the whole coverage area, and also remarkably increases the system capacity. In the environment under consideration, the simulation results reveal that SPMA can offer approximately 424 times more system capacity compared to the reference case of 3-sector site."",Authors would like to thank European Communications Engineering (ECE) Ltd and European Celtic-Plus project SHARING for supporting this research work.,,Wireless Networks,,,,2015-07-16,2015,2015-07-16,2016-05,22,4,1079-1091,Closed,Article,""Sheikh, Muhammad Usman";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Then, multiple battlefield surveillance systems can be connected together to form a battlefield surveillance network. The mobile nodes can be deployed in a certain region to monitor enemy aircrafts and missiles. Thus, some important issues have to be solved efficiently, including the cooperation across the administrative domains of a cloud network, the direction-of-arrival (DOA), and a polarization estimation algorithm for a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN). In this paper, the architecture of a battlefield surveillance system is constructed based on mobile cloud computing and 5G link. The root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC)-like algorithm is proposed for estimating the 1-D DOA and a polarization parameter with a uniform linear array. The Root-MUSIC algorithm is replaced by the Fourier transform, the former algorithm that can be extended to an arbitrary topology structure of a MWSN. Then, the proposed algorithm is extended to the 2-D DOA and a polarization estimation in further. Based on the deployment of different MWSNs, the estimation results of DOA and polarization parameters are fused in order to improve the estimation performance. Finally, the parameter information (DOA and polarization parameter) of enemy aircrafts and missiles can be achieved. The computer simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Incidentally, a significant proportion of that budget is spent on resolving outages that degrade or disrupt cellular services. Historically, operators mainly rely on human expertise to identify, diagnose, and resolve such outages. However, with growing cell density and diversifying cell types, this approach is becoming less and less viable, both technically and financially. To cope with this problem, research on self-healing solutions has gained significant momentum in recent years. Self-healing solutions either assist in resolving these outages or carry out the task autonomously without human intervention, thus reducing costs while improving mobile cellular network reliability. However, despite their growing popularity, to this date no survey has been undertaken for self-healing solutions in mobile cellular networks. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive survey of self-healing solutions proposed in the domain of mobile cellular networks, along with an analysis of the techniques and methodologies employed in those solutions. This paper begins by providing a quantitative analysis to highlight why in emerging mobile cellular network self-healing will become a necessity instead of a luxury. Building on this motivation, this paper provides a review and taxonomy of existing literature on self-healing. Challenges and prospective research directions for developing self-healing solutions for emerging and future mobile cellular networks are also discussed in detail.

In order to serve intense traffic areas, such as train stations, airports, or hot-spot buildings, the investigation on 5G networks for the next-generation mobile telecommunications has been triggered. One promising solution is the dense small cell networks which consist of a large number of small cells. Base stations (BSs) are one of the major contributors to the power consumption in cellular networks. To address the power consumption issue, the BS ON/OFF control mechanism is proposed by the 3GPP. Some previous solutions for BS ON/OFF control try to save energy by switching off as many BSs as possible. In this paper, we aim to minimize the total power consumption of a dense small cell network while offering QoS guarantees to all its user equipment (UEs). The BS ON/OFF control for minimal total power consumption of an entire network is an NP-hard problem. To this problem, we propose a clustering-based scheme for BS ON/OFF control which in the past was applied to mitigate interference. The proposed scheme is a three-phase approach, consisting of BS clustering algorithm, intra-cluster BS ON/OFF control algorithm, and inter-cluster BS ON/OFF control algorithm. By the clustering technique, we reduce an NP-hard problem to a number of manageable sub-problems. For the possibility of further power saving, we also consider the ON/OFF control of BSs residing on the boundaries of clusters. The time complexity is analyzed. Finally, experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms existing approaches in power saving and is capable of retaining QoS guarantees for all UEs."",""This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, under Grant MOST 105-2221-E-110-024-MY2."",,IEEE Access,,,,2018-12-11,2018,2018-12-11,2019-01-01,7,,2880-2893,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In these deployments, each user device may employ multiple radio access technologies to communicate with network infrastructure. With the growing numbers of such multi-radio consumer devices, mobile network operators seek to leverage spectrum across diverse radio technologies, thus boosting capacity and enhancing quality of service. In this article, we review major challenges in delivering uniform connectivity and service experience to converged multiradio heterogeneous deployments. We envision that multiple radios and associated device/infrastructure intelligence for their efficient use will become a fundamental characteristic of future 5G technologies, where the distributed unlicensed-band network (e.g., WiFi) may take advantage of the centralized control function residing in the cellular network (e.g., 3GPP LTE). Illustrating several available architectural choices for integrating WiFi and LTE networks, we specifically focus on interworking within the radio access network and detail feasible options for intelligent access network selection. Both network- and user-centric approaches are considered, wherein the control rests with the network or the user. In particular, our system-level simulation results indicate that load-aware usercentric schemes, which augment SNR measurements with additional information about network loading, could improve the performance of conventional WiFi-preferred solutions based on minimum SNR threshold. Comparison with more advanced network-controlled schemes has also been completed to confirm attractive practical benefits of distributed user-centric algorithms.

The measurement environment was a closed-plan in-building scenario that included a line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight corridor, a hallway, a cubicle farm, and adjacent-room communication links. Well-known and new single-frequency and multi-frequency directional and omnidirectional large-scale path loss models are presented and evaluated based on more than 14 000 directional power delay profiles acquired from unique transmitter and receiver antenna pointing angle combinations. Omnidirectional path loss models, synthesized from the directional measurements, are provided for the case of arbitrary polarization coupling, as well as for the specific cases of co-polarized and cross-polarized antenna orientations. The results show that novel large-scale path loss models provided here are simpler and more physically based compared to previous 3GPP and ITU indoor propagation models that require more model parameters and offer very little additional accuracy and lack a physical basis. Multipath time dispersion statistics for mmWave systems using directional antennas are presented for co-polarization, crosspolarization, and combined-polarization scenarios, and show that the multipath root mean square delay spread can be reduced when using transmitter and receiver antenna pointing angles that result in the strongest received power. Raw omnidirectional path loss data and closed-form optimization formulas for all path loss models are given in the Appendices."",,,IEEE Access,,,,2015-12-11,2015,2015-12-11,,3,,2388-2424,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the major problems faced by mmWaves is that they cannot penetrate buildings. In this paper, we utilize multihop relaying to overcome the signal blockage problem in an mmWave band. The multihop relay network comprises a source device, several relay devices, and a destination device and uses device-to-device communication. Relay devices redirect the source signal to avoid the obstacles existing in the propagation environment. Each device amplifies and forwards the signal to the next device, such that a multihop link ensures the connectivity between the source device and the destination device. We consider that the relay devices and the destination device are affected by external interference and investigate the bit error probability (BEP) of this multihop mmWave system. Note that the study of the BEP allows quantifying the quality of communication and identifying the impact of different parameters on the system reliability. In this way, the system parameters, such as the powers allocated to different devices, can be tuned to maximize the link reliability. We derive exact expressions for the BEP of $M$ -ary quadrature amplitude modulation and $M$ -ary phase-shift keying in terms of multivariate Meijer’s G-function. Due to the complicated expression of the exact BEP, a tight lower bound expression for the BEP is derived using a novel Mellin-approach. Moreover, an asymptotic expression for the BEP at high SIR regime is derived and used to determine the diversity and the coding gain of the system. In addition, we optimize the power allocation at different devices subject to a sum power constraint such that the BEP is minimized. Our analysis reveals that optimal power allocation allows achieving more than 3-dB gain compared with the equal power allocation. This paper can serve as a framework for designing and optimizing mmWave multihop relaying systems to ensure link reliability."",This work was carried out during the tenure of an ERCIM “Alain Bensoussan” Fellowship Programme.,,IEEE Access,,,,2018-01-01,2018,2018-01-15,2018-01-01,6,,3794-3808,All OA";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The design and development of such WBSN systems for health monitoring have received a large amount of attention recently, in research studies and in industry. This attention is mainly motivated by costly health care and by recent advances in the development of miniature health monitoring devices as well as emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which contribute to the main challenges of 5G. The existence of an explicit approach to address the required software design and verification should be very beneficial for the construction and maintenance of such systems. This paper presents a preventive health care system that has a flexible design. The proposed system is based on an architecture that has heterogeneous nodes and provides both daily continuous monitoring as well as specific controls. We defined a model to describe the WBSN’s global behavior. An important aspect of this work is that we propose a model-driven engineering (MDE) approach to address the derivation of each node’s behavior in the WBSN from the WBSN global behavior. This approach allows developers to obtain a system design from the global specification of its requirement. To ensure the conformance of this design to its specification, the derived behaviors should be validated and verified before their deployment. In fact, formal methods are powerful tools for software engineers to verify the logical correctness of concurrent software at different levels of its life cycle. Model checking is one of the most powerful formal methods for verifying the logical correctness of such concurrent systems. In this work, we make use of a model checking approach that is based on a model transformation to validate the automatically derived behavior of a WBSN for health monitoring. This model-driven approach will check whether the derived system behaves correctly according to its global specification, while the objective is to increase the system’s performance and QoS. This approach allows the developer to reason about a model of the global system rather than about the system itself."",,,Computer Networks,,,,2017-12,2017,,2017-12,129,,548-571,Closed,Article,""Harbouche, Ahmed";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Digital elevation models are today a common part of geographic information systems and derived applications. The way of their creation is varied.

In particular, it will lead to development of the submillimeter/THz band devices with brand new size, interference immunity and energy efficiency, for high speed video signal broadcasting, line of sight relay, for 5G cell phone transport networks, high precision radars for small size, high velocity target detection and tracking, and hidden object detection radiometric systems. Nowadays, the research of such wireless systems is focused on increase of communication channel bandwidth using superbroadband signals, which occupy all the THz band. However, it’s worth to mention, that in many perspective applications of 5th generation networks, the range has more important role, than the data transmission speed. The goal of the article is the increase of communication center’s information efficiency by the development of innovative solution for construction of the wireless broadband subscriber channel for information resource access using THz band, which provides greater efficiency in the channel’s range and bit rate. The results of THz-band wireless broadband access technical solution analysis are being provided here. The implementation of broadband access requires designating significant informational resource amount per subscriber, which, if the designated resource amount is not enough, leads to decrease in efficiency in service providing. Today’s lack of transmitter/receiver hardware of decent cost, when using unlicensed THz frequencies in backhaul network channels, leads to significant decrease of backhaul network channel length, which means decrease of the network zone size. Therefore, to avoid these flaws, the new technical solution for every subscriber’s bit rate increase, the subscriber amount increase on the territory covered by the access point, and the service coverage territory expansion possibility, is being provided here. During the THz-band channel broadcast system deployment process, one of the main issue is the channel and time resource distribution between the wireless communication system’s different sectors (directions), which is due to the change of traffic quality and amount. A generalized channel and time resource amount prediction algorithm is being provided for high efficiency wireless access channel. The control of such system can be done similarly to the server network.

"234,pub.1125269191,10.1149/ma2018-01/19/1267,,,Tailoring the Surface Morphology and Microstructure of Electrodeposited Copper Foil with Organic Additives,""Copper foil manufactured by high-speed electrochemical deposition (ED) is an essential material for its extensive applications such as the negative current collector for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) or building up the designed connection pattern on the printed circuit boards (PCBs). Thus, producing copper foil with optimal quality and machinability depending on the end products is necessary. For example, the thickness of Cu foils for LIBs should be thin (< 10 µm) to reduce the volume and weight of batteries but the mechanical properties should remain strong enough to go through the roll-to-roll manufacturing process without fracture. In addition, the surface roughness on both sides should be identically smooth and glossy to provide the coating carbon materials with acceptable wetability and adhesion. On the other hand, Cu foils for the fifth generation (5G) high-frequency wireless devices should be exceedingly smooth because the skin depth of copper caused by the so-called skin effect is merely 0.266 µm when the transmitting frequency of signals is up to 60 GHz. Thus, a great majority of electric current passing through the conductor will flow extremely near the surface. Under such circumstances, coarse surface roughness has a significant detrimental effect on the signal loss of wireless communication devices, and consequently, the surface morphology and mechanical properties of copper foils should be further improved in order to meet the requirements for the next generation electronic devices. The microstructure of copper fabricated by ED depends highly on plating parameters, including current density, convection rate of the electrolyte, pulsed/direct current deposition, or using appropriate organic additives to ameliorate the nucleation behavior of Cu from cupric ions. Manufacturing of ED copper foils ought to operate with very high current density and high temperature to promote the yield rate for mass production, and the gelatin-based additive has been used for a long time. However, grain structure and surface roughness are coarse and mechanical properties are merely acceptable with around 250 MPa tensile strength and a 4% elongation rate for a normal 18 µm foil. In this work, we demonstrate the copper foil fabricated by high-speed electrodeposition with a current density of 450 mA/cm2 (average growth rate > 150 nm/s) from a 54oC bath, which meets the required yield rate for genuine mass-production, and tailoring the microstructure of copper with selective additives. The surface morphology of the foil facing the electrolyte side is smooth by our designed additives, and surface roughness values, Ra and Rq, are less than 100 nm, which are as smooth as foils manufactured via rolling process. In addition, the structure of copper is further tuned by a specific additive, and the grain size of copper is getting smaller as the concentration of this additive is increased. When the concentration of this additive is up to 800 ppm, the average grain size of copper is shrunk from 3 µm to 0.3 µm, and extremely unique copper texture with nearly single (220) orientation is constructed. Owing to such delicate microstructure, considerable improvement in mechanical properties with more than 40 % increase in tensile strength and 4 times increase in the elongation rate compared to the conventional gelatin-based copper foil is achieved. The surface morphology and structure of copper foil are properly characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tensile testing machine, and the applied additive to tailor the structure of copper will be clearly revealed and discussed. Finally, a novel and commercially realizable scheme to fabricate copper foil with ultra smooth surface morphology and ductile mechanical properties by high-speed ED is proposed."",,,ECS Meeting Abstracts,,,,2018-04-13,2018,,2018-04-13,MA2018-01,19,1267-1267,Closed,Article,""Lin, Chun-Cheng";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
