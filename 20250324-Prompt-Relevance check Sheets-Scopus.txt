Analyse the following text.
It contains bibliometric information on scientific publications.
In the following part of the prompt, I will describe the contents of the text file:
	The content is structured and separated by double semicolons (`;;`) in this order:
	- Title
	- Abstract
	- Keywords

Your task is to evaluate each entry based on the following:
Subject area of interest: “Use of 5G technology in research in the field of construction and civil engineering”

Please answer the following criterions individually for each entry and give a percentage rating (0% = doesn't answer the question at all, 100% = a comprehensiv, explicit explaination to the criterion is given).

These are the criterions:
	1) Is 5G technology being used in the construction industry?
	2) What use cases for 5G are currently described in the literature?
	3) How is the introduction of 5G technology described for the user?
	4) Which theoretical approaches are used to describe the introduction of the technology?

In the next step, create an overall rating including the results of criterion 1 to criterion 4 by calculating the mean value.
Use a clear weighting of the four criteria:
Criterion 1: 35%
Criterion 2: 35%
Criterion 3: 15%
Criterion 4: 15%

Finally explain, why briefly why the final rating was given in a maximum of two sentences. 

The result could look like this and were seperated with a semicolon:
Title: [Insert title];
Criterion 1: [e,g, 85%]; 
Criterion 2: [e,g, 45%];  
Criterion 3: [e,g, 100%];
Criterion 4: [e,g, 0%];
Overall Rating: [e.g. 60%];
Explanation: [Short justification based on the four criteria]

Do not explain the decision for the single criterions but just for the overall rating
